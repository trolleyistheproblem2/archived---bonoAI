       "Title: Bihar's Chirand has a 4000-year history. It's the 'rising sun' of India's Neolithic culture\\n\\nURL Source: https://theprint.in/opinion/bihars-chirand-has-a-4000-year-history-its-the-rising-sun-of-indias-neolithic-culture/1954039/\\n\\nPublished Time: 2024-02-05T08:06:11+00:00\\n\\nMarkdown Content:\\nThe story of continuity and change in a country with diverse ecosystems varies from region to region. It is important to consider the microhabitats and landscapes that shape the cultures and traditions we inherit. Some regions have been occupied for many millennia, resulting in a long history with no breaks or gaps in the chronology. However, there are some examples in archaeology of sites that have been occupied for a long time but have had gaps in occupation; the infamous site of [Hastinapura](https://theprint.in/opinion/bihars-chirand-has-a-4000-year-history-its-the-rising-sun-of-indias-neolithic-culture/1954039/blank) is a prime example of such chrono-cultural history.\\n\\nThere are also examples of a region with multiple sites deciphering the story of continuity and change, the classical example of this would be the sites of [Mehrgarh](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b7x6xx), [Nausharo](https://theprint.in/opinion/bihars-chirand-has-a-4000-year-history-its-the-rising-sun-of-indias-neolithic-culture/1954039/blank) and [Pirak](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/11263509609439562), together showcasing the evolution of culture from early farming to the Bronze Age. Therefore, it is not necessary that an individual site will have to give an entire picture of the region’s historicity; there can be multiple sites in a region that can offer you a glimpse of shifts in the cultural paradigm.\\n\\n[Chirand,](https://ehrafarchaeology.yale.edu/traditions/aq50/documents/010) an archaeological site in Bihar, is a combination of these two distinct examples. The site narrates a regional evolution of society from the Neolithic to the Early Historical period after which it was deserted till the Mediaeval period. But when combined with other sites on the banks of the Ganga, such as [Maner](https://www.telegraphindia.com/bihar/new-year-date-for-maner-excavation-archaeologists-expect-to-find-artefacts-dating-back-to-neolithic-age-and-pal-period/cid/349766), [Chechar](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/relics-of-india-s-golden-age-discovered-in-bihar/story-UFBBSlznIEiQpdjvxLqzRN.html) and Senuar, it provides valuable information on the over-4000-year history of the region.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n_**Also Read:** [Is there a ‘void’ in Indian history? Brahmagiri, Maski hold the answer](https://theprint.in/opinion/is-there-a-void-in-indian-history-brahmagiri-maski-hold-the-answer/1933821/)  \\n_\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### **The Rising Sun of Bihar**\\n\\nOnce called the ‘rising sun of the neolithic culture in India’ by archaeologist [FR Allchin](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bulletin-of-the-school-of-oriental-and-african-studies/article/abs/f-r-allchin-piklihal-excavations-andhra-pradesh-government-archaeological-series-no-1-xvii-154-pp-64-plates-hyderabad-government-of-andhra-pradesh-1960-rs-15/899F551FD0CA064CBCB51E995001D146), Chirand is an archaeological site located in the Saran district of Bihar. The site was first reported after a surface study in the late 1800s— when Mediaeval structures and Buddhist sculptures were found. The initial excavations, conducted in 1962 by the Directorate of Archaeology and Museum, Bihar, lasted for seven field seasons till 1972-73.\\n\\nA five-fold cultural sequence was revealed during the excavation which was broadly categorised as –\\n\\n**Period I** – Neolithic (early food-producing period)\\n\\n**Period II** – Chalcolithic (Copper-using society)\\n\\n**Period III** – Northern Black Polished Ware-associated culture (linked with the rise of ancient republics)\\n\\n**Period IV**– Historical period (from 1st century to 3rd century BCE)\\n\\n**Period V**– Late Historical\\n\\nThe neolithic society at Chirand settled on the alluvial deposit of the Ganga River in circular houses made of wild reeds. A circular floor about four metres in diameter with a series of open hearths, a few post-holes near the floor and a few burnt chunks of clay with a reed impression are valuable pieces of evidence that speak volumes about neolithic settlement style and social matrix.\\n\\nBone tools, styli, tanged and socketed arrowheads, bangles of ivory and tortoise bone, and many bone ornaments from the Neolithic phase are indicative of a highly skilled society which focused on utilising animal bones in many ways. Apart from this, beads made of chalcedony, agate, jasper, marble, chert, steatite and faience—which were sources from across the subcontinent—link the settlers of Chirand to the domestic trade matrix. Material like faience must be the result of exchange with the Harappans in the west, whereas agate was probably coming from Gujarat.\\n\\nThe evidence of rice, wheat, barley and masoor [at Chirand](https://ehrafarchaeology.yale.edu/traditions/aq50/documents/008) suggests that people, during Period I, were cultivating cereals and legumes. Fish also was part of their diet.\\n\\nSuch a complex society of early farmers in eastern India at around c.2400 BCE is a marker of indigenous growth of culture, which is connected to its contemporary settlements around Chirand and across the Ganga in the west.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n_**Also Read:** [Calling Harappan Civilisation ‘Vedic Saraswati’ is extreme—learn to hold a trowel first](https://theprint.in/opinion/calling-harappan-civilisation-vedic-saraswati-is-extreme-learn-to-hold-a-trowel-first/1914084/)_\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### **Evolution to copper**\\n\\nThe inclusion of metal is a sign of evolution, both of society and of technology. Copper was the first metal which slowly penetrated the social fabric i[n Chirand.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44145448) This brought about the onset of the Chalcolithic period.\\n\\nThe early dates of the Copper Age—which succeeded the early farming period and paved the way for iron—come from the western half of the subcontinent. But this may be a generalised statement because the juncture when the Neolithic ends and Chalcolithic begins might not follow a linear pattern in every microcosm. It can merge in the initial stages before paving the way for a full-fledged Copper Age, just like at [Maski](https://theprint.in/opinion/is-there-a-void-in-indian-history-brahmagiri-maski-hold-the-answer/1933821/), Karnataka. Moreover, in some instances, they co-exist, as we have seen in the case of [Burzahom](https://theprint.in/opinion/buzahom-can-change-story-of-evolution-until-recently-it-was-a-kashmiri-t20-cricket-ground/1474410/) and Harappa.\\n\\nIn the case of Chirand, both scenarios stand true. At the site, the Neolithic period slowly transitions into the Chalcolithic period. But when placing the site with its contemporary sites in the same region as Maner, the [Neolithic period of Chirand](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44145448) co-exists with the Chalcolithic period of Maner which is dated to 2600 BCE.\\n\\nThe Chalcolithic period in Chirand is dated around c.2000 to 1950 BCE and covers about 5.5m thickness of the total deposit. The copper-using people lived in houses made of reeds and bamboo with mud plaster and floors made of burnt earth. Circular hearths are noted in the earliest levels of the deposit. Secondary burials were also recorded during the excavation.\\n\\nBone tools continue to make an appearance along with stone beads. A few corroded pieces of copper were excavated along with a few pear-shaped terracotta beads.\\n\\nThis phase slowly merges into Period III— the Iron Age.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n_**Also Read:** [Archaeological tourism is on the rise.

The Iron Age in the subcontinent is a much-debated topic. While the exact date of the introduction of iron is still debatable, its inclusion in the material culture is considered important— so much so that early scholars called the Iron Age the foundation of second urbanism in India.\\n\\nAt [Chirand](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44145448), the introduction of iron is coupled with the presence of Northern Black Polish Ware which, like iron, is a product of advanced kilning technique. Iron implements found at the site include sickles, axes, ploughshares, daggers, lances, knife blades, etc. Beads of semi-precious stones and terracotta beads are also part of the material assemblage at the site. Terracotta human and animal figures including the naga figurine are important findings. Copper antimony rods, bone arrowheads, copper-punch marked coins and cast coins were also found during this period. What is interesting is that Neolithic celts \\[a tool from the period\\] were also present in this period. A drastic change in settlement pattern was in the building material. Baked brick structures start to appear, with mud walls and rammed floors. Period III was followed by Period IV—from 1st century BCE to 3rd century CE—which was ruled by the Kushana dynasty. During this period big residential complexes and monastic buildings are reported. Several structural phases are noted, one of which included remnants of a monastic kitchen which yielded a terracotta torso of Hariti. An important discovery of this period was the Kushana copper coin hoard of 88 coins, and a terracotta sealing with the early Brahmi script. Period V is the last phase which revealed that the site was deserted after 3rd century CE and reoccupied after a considerable gap during the late historical and early Mediaeval period. The periodisation is indicated by the recovery of a pot with five gold coins of the Kalachuri dynasty ruler Gangeyadeva dated c.1045 CE, and the presence of an unidentified sculpture from the Pala period. ### **Continuity and change** At [Brahmagiri](https://theprint.in/opinion/is-there-a-void-in-indian-history-brahmagiri-maski-hold-the-answer/1933821/) and [Maski](https://theprint.in/opinion/is-there-a-void-in-indian-history-brahmagiri-maski-hold-the-answer/1933821/), cultures changed and the landscape evolved with time. Similarly, at Chirand, early neolithic farmers co-existed and evolved alongside the copper-using society, and at the same time distinctively showed how easily cultures change and merge at one location. From humble wattle and daub structures emerged rammed floors, community hearths, and burnt bricks, changing the settlement style which eventually became the hallmark of urbanism. The Kushana occupation that follows, is also an example of how the region, and most importantly Chirand itself, is [significant](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44145448) – perhaps due to political reasons or maybe just due to trade.\\n\\n[Today](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/famous-archaeological-site-in-bihar-faces-threat-of-erosion-101624801867323.html), Chirand is rapidly being consumed by the Ganga, recently fresh excavations opened up a glorious chapter of the history of eastern India, leaving us waiting for more data.\\n\\n_An earlier version of this article wrongly identified an archaeological site as Chirand.

       "Title: Nuclear-Testing 'Downwinders' Speak about History and Fear\\n\\nURL Source: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nuclear-testing-downwinders-speak-about-history-and-fear/\\n\\nPublished Time: 2022-01-27T14:00:00+00:00\\n\\nMarkdown Content:\\nWhen Sandra Evans Walsh was growing up in Parowan, Utah, her class would sometimes trek outside to a row of trees. They were about to watch history in the making, the teacher would tell them. The kids would then stare as an orange shroud spread across the sky. “I remember the clouds coming over our town and writing our names in the dust,” she said [in an interview](https://collections.lib.utah.edu/ark:/87278/s6hq8s4r) with Justin Sorensen, a geographical information systems (GIS) specialist at the University of Utah’s J. Willard Marriott Library.\\n\\nThat dust had traveled around 200 miles, all the way from what is now called the Nevada National Security Site, where scientists once tested nuclear weapons. Between 1945 and 1962, U.S. researchers [detonated](https://www.osti.gov/opennet/manhattan-project-history/publications/DOENuclearTests.pdf) around 200 bombs aboveground—100 of them in Nevada. Fallout from the nuclear tests—radioactive particles that were swept into the atmosphere and fell back down to the earth—found their way into crops and livestock, whose radioactivity humans took on when they consumed milk, meat and produce. Fallout takes many different chemical forms, one of which is iodine-131: an isotope, or version, of iodine that has the usual 53 protons but 78 neutrons instead of the standard 74. Inside the body, the thyroid gland will absorb iodine-131, which eventually decays to produce radiation that can causethyroid cancer and other problems.\\n\\nPeople, such as Walsh, who lived “downwind” of nuclear development and open-air explosions are now called “downwinders.” Mary Dickson, another downwinder, [told Sorensen and one of his colleagues](https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=1246432&q) that she thought the attitude toward those in Utah who were affected by nuclear testing was, “you know, ‘They were Mormons and cowboys and Indians—who cares?’ In general, she added, “they test where they think there are populations that don’t matter.”\\n\\nSorensen and his team spoke to both women and dozens of other people for a project called the Downwinders of Utah Archive. Hosted by the J. Willard Marriott Library, the archive is an attempt to qualify, quantify and make accessible people’s experiences of, and effects from, the American legacy of nuclear weapons testing. In 2011 the Senate unanimously designated January 27 as the National Day of Remembrance for Downwinders. “The downwinders paid a high price for the development of a nuclear weapons program for the benefit of the United States,” [stated](https://www.congress.gov/112/bills/sres330/BILLS-112sres330ats.pdf) the resolution establishing the designation.\\n\\nBut when the tests were conducted, no one had done the research necessary to truly calculate what that price would be. Wanting to understand the potential link between regional health issues and fallout from nuclear tests, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) undertook [a study](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/i131-report-and-appendix) on Americans exposed to iodine-131 from the Nevada tests. [The results](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/i131-report-and-appendix) were released in 1997 in a report entitled “Estimated Exposures and Thyroid Doses Received by the American People from Iodine-131 in Fallout following Nevada Atmospheric Nuclear Bomb Tests.” It was this document that first led Sorensen to the archival project. “We were just kind of wondering, originally, ‘What does this data look like if you put it on a map?’” he says, “because a spreadsheet doesn’t really tell you a lot.” Sorensen’s background is in GIS and cartography, so he took the NCI’s fallout data and overlaid them onto his home state. “It just really grew from there,” he says. “We started seeing there's a story to be told.”\\n\\nThat story, Sorensen knew, included individual human narratives. So he and his team used their maps to pinpoint hotspots in the Beehive State. Advertising in heavily dosed places, such as St. George and Cedar City, the archivists asked people to come to their local libraries and share their experiences. “We came back with 30-plus interviews,” Sorensen says.\\n\\nSome interviewees told Sorensen of men who examined their thyroids or of the potassium iodide pills teachers passed out to combat the effects of radiation. Dickson recalled watching public-information films starring [Bert the Turtle](https://www.loc.gov/static/programs/national-film-preservation-board/documents/duck_cover.pdf), who taught kids to duck and cover in the event of a nuclear explosion. The film, though, was not really a warning about what your own country might do inside its borders.\\n\\nAlongside the interviews, Sorensen collected hard geospatial data and analysis. Web visitors to his archive can survey [iodine fallout maps](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9U0T4P-RpilbWdQSDg1c3ZqUFk/view?resourcekey=0-OvI6LYYD0t-7furhCq6tMQ), [diagrams of mushroom-cloud heights for different test series](https://sites.google.com/site/projectstorage2015/downwinders-screenshots/Operation%20Teapot%20Cloud%20Height%20Diagram.jpg), animations of nuclear [air drops](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9U0T4P-RpilTUxjMmhJREgtR3c/view?resourcekey=0-JDDveE0Hx-XygDkKes3f_A), [milk consumption statistics](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-EnaKGTzTEsA/VVS6uA6SFhI/AAAAAAAADSM/Y4DtDANUBwg/w1279-h959-no/Average%2BMilk%2BProduction%2B%2526%2BConsumption%2BNumbers%2Bfor%2B1954.png) from when contaminated cows passed their burden on and an [interactive timeline](https://lib.utah.edu/services/geospatial/downwinders/) of the explosive atomic age. “I was really surprised just how closely and accurately the interviews match the data,” Sorensen says. In particular, he cites a test in the Operation Upshot-Knothole series. Later the test was nicknamed “[Dirty Harry](https://www.ctbto.org/specials/testing-times/19-may-1953-dirty-harry/)” because it generated more fallout than any other continental boom, much of which ended up near St. George. “You hear this firsthand, and it brings all the information together,” he says.\\n\\nAlthough no single illness can be conclusively tied to a test-site cause, investigations by the [United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation](http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/gareport.pdf) and the [International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War and the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research](https://ieer.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/1991/06/RadioactiveHeavenEarth1991.pdf), among others, have established links between radiation exposure and cancer occurrence. In the early 2000s a [report](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/fallout/) by NCI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that fallout could have led to around [11,000 excess deaths](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/fallout/feasibilitystudy/Technical_Vol_1_Chapter_4.pdf). The NCI has also created [a calculator](https://radiationcalculators.cancer.gov/fallout/) that allows users to calculate their thyroid dose and risk of developing thyroid cancer from fallout. “We can’t know any individual’s cancer was caused by radioactivity,” explains Scott Williams, former executive director of HEAL Utah, a nonprofit advocacy group focused on the environment and public health, “but we do know that some people’s cancer risk was increased by radioactivity.”\\n\\nSince 1990 the federal government has offered some recompense to downwinders and others affected by nuclear testing through the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA). Set to expire this summer unless [a bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2798) is passed to renew (and expand) it, RECA pays downwinders, test participants and uranium workers between $50,000 and $100,000—if they have specific ailments and can prove (with decades-old evidence that is sometimes hard to come by) they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. “We left a burden on unwitting citizens across the country without ever informing them,” Williams says. “We need to do the honorable thing and own the problem and not create these problems again.”\\n\\nThe Downwinders of Utah Archive is always expanding, and though Sorensen paused interviews during the pandemic, he plans to light the fuse again soon. He also hopes to expand the project to other Western states to preserve their history, too.\\n\\nMaking sure that information remains accessible is part of the point of the Downwinders of Utah Archive. The day of remembrance is, in its own way, an isotope of that openness. “Those kind of markers are really important...,” Dickson told Sorensen and his colleague. “Otherwise, you know, time marches on, and it’s like dipping a big spoon in the water. The rest of the water just fills in, and it’s like it was never there.”\\n\\nThis reporting was supported by the [International Women’s Media Foundation’s](https://www.iwmf.org/) Howard G Buffett Fund

When you wash the rice, do it gently to avoid bruising the rice so they don’t break while cooking.\\n*   While cooking the rice, avoid stirring the rice.\\n*   Only par cook the potatoes for 3 to 5 minutes. After straining them cook for an additional 5 minutes with the chicken masala.\\n*   Later when the potatoes steam cook with the rice, they will be cooked thru and soft but won’t break easily when you scoop the biryani.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nIf you like this recipe, please leave a review and don’t forget to follow me on instagram.\\n\\nKarachi Style Deighi Biryani\\n----------------------------\\n\\nRecipe by Fatima Maniya Soorty Course: Main courseCuisine: PakistaniDifficulty: Intermediate\\n\\nNo tomato, no onion Karachi style Deighi Biryani with potatoes.\\n\\n### Ingredients\\n\\n*   1 whole chicken (16 pcs)\\n\\n*   2 tbsp ginger garlic paste\\n\\n*   3 tbsp Bombay Biryani Masala\\n\\n*   3 tbsp Sindhi Biryani Masala\\n\\n*   3-4 Fresh Green chili\\n\\n*   2 tsp roasted cumin coriander powder\\n\\n*   1.5 tsp garam masala\\n\\n*   1/2 tsp turmeric\\n\\n*   2 tsp crushed red chili flakes\\n\\n*   1 tsp salt\\n\\n*   1/4 cup tomato paste\\n\\n*   1/4 cup yogurt\\n\\n*   1/4 cup ghee\\n\\n*   4 tbsp oil\\n\\n*   4 potatoes\\n\\n*   1/4 tsp yellow food color\\n\\n*   1/4 tsp salt\\n\\n*   Water as needed\\n\\n*   **For the layering**\\n*   4 tbsp yogurt\\n\\n*   2 tsp yellow food color\\n\\n*   Handful of cilantro\\n\\n*   Handful of mint leaves\\n\\n*   2 green chilies\\n\\n*   3 tbsp chaat masala\\n\\n*   **For the Rice**\\n*   3.5 cup Basmati Rice\\n\\n*   2 tsp cumin seeds\\n\\n*   1/2inch cinnamon stick\\n\\n*   1 bay leaf\\n\\n*   2 fresh green chilies\\n\\n*   1 black cardamom pods\\n\\n*   2 tbsp salt\\n\\n*   2 tbsp vinegar\\n\\n*   Water for boiling\\n\\n\\n### Directions\\n\\n*   In a pot add oil and ghee, then add the chicken and marinate it with ginger garlic paste, Sindhi Biryani Masala, Bombay Biryani Masala, garam Masala, green chili, roasted cumin and coriander powder, chili flakes, turmeric, tomato paste, yogurt and salt.\\n*   Turn on the heat and fry the marinated chicken on low heat for 3-5 minutes.\\n*   Once the masala starts changing color and thickens, add 1/4 cup water.\\n*   Put the lid on and continue cooking on low heat for 10 minutes.\\n*   Meanwhile, peel and quarter potatoes and boil them for 3-5 minutes with 1/4 tsp food color.\\n*   Drain the potatoes and add them to the same pot as the chicken and cook for an additional 3-5 minutes.\\n*   Turn off the heat after 5 minutes.\\n*   **For the Rice**\\n*   In a large pot boil around 4-5 cups of water.

It was a monumental practice session, one of the few that matched Jaiswal's long sessions,\" Bharucha revealed.\\n\\nA day in a Test match has 90 overs, which is 540 balls plus extras, but 140 overs is effectively 840 deliveries in a single day. How was that even possible?\\n\\nBharucha explained the process.\\n\\n\"All (bowlers and throwdown men) are standing there at the same time. And the sequence is one throws for the flick. Next one for the cut. Next one for the pull. Next one for the straight drive. We do this on multiple surfaces (spinning, grass, bounce, wet cement), with multiple types of balls (rubber, tennis, cricket) and multiple types of bats (heavy/light/thin etc).\\n\\n\"Within this also we have one bunch who do it with the hand and the next bunch who do it with the wanger (throwdown apparatus Roboarm). Behind them are the spinners, and behind them the fast bowlers.\\n\\n\"So, one round in the nets would comprise around 14 people throwing, wanging and bowling, as opposed to the traditional way, where you may have like three spinners and three fast bowlers (for example) bowling one round.\\n\\n\"That's how we got through 140 overs in a day's practice for Dhruv,\" he said.\\n\\nBharucha explained the need for young batters to practice 'sequencing' where they know that no two deliveries will be same, and that's how the batter prepares for all eventualities.\\n\\n\"The discussion before this innings with Dhruv was 'go down to the level of your practice and everything will be fine'. The talk is always about staying hungry.\\n\\n\"Like Jaiswal did to Anderson. First flick into the on-side, then you know you are forcing the bowler to bowl outside off, so let's be prepared to attack him in that region (six over cover). Then he can't bowl outside off or outside leg.\\n\\n\"So you can attack him straight down the ground (six down the ground). All our practice is set up in this manner. No two balls will land in the same spot during our drills. We even have our set throwers who are named Flick, Cut, Pull, Drive. It's funny but our boys loved it.\"\\n\\nDestiny does play a role for people who are destined to achieve great things. It was Jurel's U19 and UP teammate Kartik Tyagi who recommended him for Rajasthan Royals trials.\\n\\nFunnily, there was another batter-keeper, an U19 World Cup winner (2018) named Aryan Juyal, who also did well in trials and scouts were a bit confused.\\n\\nBut Bharucha always knew whom they were signing.\\n\\n\"I remembered him (Jurel) hitting this one ball over extra cover for an enormous six and thought this looked different and special. Even our own RR selection team was confused which player we were going after.\\n\\n\"But I requested them to check the video of the guy who hit that six over extra cover and they came back saying it was Dhruv Jurel. I was very clear that's the one RR should be chasing come the auction day.\"\\n\\n(Published\\n\\n25 February 2024, 13:03\\n\\nIST)\\n\\nFollow us on\\n------------\\n\\n[Read More](#)\\n

Built between 437 and 432 BCE as a part of the [Periklean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles\"Pericles\") Building Program, it was the last in a series of gatehouses built on the citadel. Its architect was [Mnesikles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnesikles\"Mnesikles\"), his only known building. It is evident from traces left on the extant building that the plan for the Propylaia evolved considerably during its construction, and that the project was ultimately abandoned in an unfinished state.\\n\\nHistory\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Propylaia_(Acropolis_of_Athens)&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: History\")\\]\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Propylon_topographical_map.jpg/220px-Propylon_topographical_map.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Propylon_topographical_map.jpg)\\n\\nTopographical map of the Propylaia by G. Kawerau, reconstructions are in red.[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-1) The remains of the Older Propylon are indicated at 87, and its conjectured placement is the dotted red line adjacent.\\n\\nThe approach to the Acropolis is determined by its geography. The only easily accessible pathway to the plateau lies between what is now the bastion of the [Temple of Athena Nike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Athena_Nike\"TempleofAthenaNike\") and the terrace of the [Agrippa Monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestal_of_Agrippa\"PedestalofAgrippa\"). In [Mycenaean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helladic_chronology\"Helladicchronology\") times the bastion (also referred to as the pyrgos or tower) was encased in a [cyclopean wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclopean_wall\"Cyclopeanwall\"), and amongst the few Mycenaean structures left in the archaeological record is a substantial wall on the terrace of the bastion that was part of the system of fortifications of the Acropolis.[\\[2\\]](#cite_note-2) This wall must have terminated at the first gateway, though opinions differ on the reconstruction of this earliest entrance.[\\[3\\]](#cite_note-3) At some point in the archaic period a ramp replaced the bedrock pathway; the buttress wall on the north side of the existing stairway is from this period.[\\[4\\]](#cite_note-4) This was followed shortly after [Marathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Marathon\"BattleofMarathon\") by a programme of renovation on the Acropolis including the replacement of the gateway with a ceremonial entrance, usually referred to as the Older Propylon, and the refurbishment of the forecourt in front of it.[\\[5\\]](#cite_note-5) At this time, a section of the western [Bronze Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age\"BronzeAge\") wall, south of the gateway, received a marble lining on its western face and an integrated base at the northern extent for a _[perirrhanterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Perirrhanterion&action=edit&redlink=1\"Perirrhanterion(pagedoesnotexist)\")_, or lustral basin. Bundgaard identified several remnants of this propylon and postulated a significant gatehouse situated between the Mycenaean wall and the archaic apsidal structure known as Building B.[\\[6\\]](#cite_note-6) What is evident, however, is that if the archaic gatehouse was not destroyed in the [Persian attack of 480](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_destruction_of_Athens\"AchaemeniddestructionofAthens\") then it must surely have been dismantled to facilitate the building works later in the century.[\\[7\\]](#cite_note-7)\\n\\n[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Athens_Propylaia_plan.jpg/220px-Athens_Propylaia_plan.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Athens_Propylaia_plan.jpg)\\n\\nPropylaia's conjectured original plan in gray, extant building in black\\n\\nMnesikles was appointed architect of the new propylon in 438.[\\[8\\]](#cite_note-8) From traces left in the construction of the final building it has been possible to reconstruct the development of the building plans during its construction. It was the practice of Greek builders to prepare for the bonding of joining walls, roof timber and other features in advance of the following phase of construction. From the socket for the roof beam and the spur walls on the north and south flanks of the central hall it can be discerned that the original plan was for a much larger building than its final form.[\\[9\\]](#cite_note-9) Mnesikles had planned a gatehouse composed of five halls: a central hall that would be the processional route to the Acropolis, two perpendicular flanking halls – north and south of the central hall – that would have spanned the whole width of the western end of the plateau, and two further, eastward projecting halls that were at 90 degrees to the north-south halls. Of these only the central hall, the north-east hall (the Pinakotheke) and a truncated version of the south-east hall reached completion. Furthermore, it is evident from the adaption of the [stylobate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylobate\"Stylobate\") that a stepped platform was added to the interior of the central hall such that the western-most [tympanum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tympanum_(architecture) \"Tympanum (architecture)\") and roof were raised above the rest of the building. The reasons for these alterations have been the cause of much speculation. They include practical considerations of the site,[\\[10\\]](#cite_note-10) religious objections to the displacement of the adjoining shrines,[\\[11\\]](#cite_note-11) and cost.[\\[12\\]](#cite_note-12) Whatever the reason it is clear that the project was abandoned in an unfinished state in 432 with the lifting bosses remaining and the surface of the [ashlar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashlar\"Ashlar\") blocks left undressed.\\n\\n[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Fachada_este%2C_Propileos%2C_Atenas%2C_Grecia%2C_2019_03.jpg/220px-Fachada_este%2C_Propileos%2C_Atenas%2C_Grecia%2C_2019_03.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fachada_este,_Propileos,_Atenas,_Grecia,_2019_03.jpg)\\n\\n\"Lifting bosses\"[\\[13\\]](#cite_note-13) on the Propylaia\\n\\nAlterations to the Propylaia in the classical period were slight,[\\[14\\]](#cite_note-14) the most significant being the construction of a monumental stairway in [pentelic marble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Pentelicus#Pentelic_marble\"MountPentelicus\") built in the reign of [Claudius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius\"Claudius\"), probably 42 CE, and arranged as a straight flight of steps.[\\[15\\]](#cite_note-15) This included a central inclined plane along which the sacrificial animals could be led, also a small [dog-leg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog-leg_(stairs) \"Dog-leg (stairs)\") stairway on the Nike bastion that led to the Temple of Athena Nike. This project was supervised by the Athenian Tib. Claudius Novius,[\\[16\\]](#cite_note-16) and is assumed to have been an Imperial benefaction from the great expense that must have been occurred.[\\[17\\]](#cite_note-17)\\n\\nThe Propylaia’s post-classical history sees it return to a military function beginning with the construction of the [Beulé Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beul%C3%A9_Gate\"BeuléGate\")[\\[18\\]](#cite_note-18) in the late third century CE, perhaps associated with the refortification of Athens in the form of the [Post-Herulian Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_walls_of_Athens\"CitywallsofAthens\").[\\[19\\]](#cite_note-19) Built from the dismantled elements of the [Choragic Monument of Nikias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choragic_Monument_of_Nikias\"ChoragicMonumentofNikias\") this gate may have been in response to the [Herulian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herulian\"Herulian\") invasions.[\\[20\\]](#cite_note-20) Sometime in the early [Byzantine period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_period\"Byzantineperiod\") the south wing was converted into a chapel. This conversion must not have taken place before the end of the sixth century, since in all other cases of ancient monuments being converted into Christian churches, there is no evidence of an earlier application of such a process.[\\[21\\]](#cite_note-21) The central section of the Propylaia was converted into a church in the tenth century CE when it was dedicated to the Taxiarches. The colonnade of the north-east wing was also walled off. In the same period, and specifically during the reign of [Justinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justinian\"Justinian\"), the large cistern between the north wing and the central building of the Propylaia was also constructed.[\\[22\\]](#cite_note-22) During the [De la Roche era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Athens\"DuchyofAthens\") of occupation the complex was converted to a fortified residence similar in form to the crusader castles of the [Levant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant\"Levant\") by building the [Rizokastro Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_walls_of_Athens\"CitywallsofAthens\"), fortifying the [Klepsydra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klepsydra_(Akropolis) \"Klepsydra (Akropolis)\"), removing the entrance through the [Beulé Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beul%C3%A9_Gate\"BeuléGate\"), building the protective enclosure in front of the gate to the west of the south-west corner of the Nike Tower (now the only remaining entrance to the Acropolis) and also building the bastion between the Nike bastion and the Agrippa pedestal.[\\[23\\]](#cite_note-23) The Propylaia then served as Ducal Palace to the [Acciaioli family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acciaioli_family\"Acciaiolifamily\"), at which time the so-called [Frankish Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankish_Tower_(Acropolis_of_Athens) \"Frankish Tower (Acropolis of Athens)\") was built.

From 1834 onwards the Medieval and Turkish additions to the Propylaia were demolished. By 1875 the Frankish Tower built on the south wing of the Propylaia was demolished, this marked the end of the clearing of the site of its post-classical accretions.

Beyond this is the archaic ramp leading to the zig-zag Mnesiklean ramp that remains today. Immediately ahead is the U-shaped structure of the central hall and eastward wings. The central hall is a [hexastyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexastyle\"Hexastyle\") Doric [pronaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronaos\"Pronaos\") whose central intercolumniation is spaced one [triglyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyph\"Triglyph\") and one [metope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metope\"Metope\") wider than the others. This central pathway, which leads through to the plateau, passes under a double row of [Ionic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_order\"Ionicorder\") columns the capitals of which are orientated north-south, and is axially parallel with the [Parthenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenon\"Parthenon\"). The westward-projecting wings are attached to the central hall by way of a tristyle in antis Doric colonnade of a scale two-thirds of that of the central hall. The [crepidoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crepidoma\"Crepidoma\") of the wings is in the canonical three-step form and in Pentelic marble, but the last course of the [euthynteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthynteria\"Euthynteria\") below is in a contrasting blue Eleusian limestone. The [orthostates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthostates\"Orthostates\") of the two wings were also made of dark Eleusinian limestone, this visual continuity was maintained with the orthostates of the central hall and the top step on the interior flight of stairs all constructed in the same limestone.[\\[26\\]](#cite_note-26) The interior of the Central Hall is divided by a wall in which there are five doorways symmetrically arranged; the eponymous gates. The ceilings were supported by marble beams (about 6 m long) and the innermost squares of the [coffers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffer\"Coffer\") (Doric and Ionic coffers were both used) were decorated either with golden stars on a blue field with a bright green margin or an arrangement of [palmettes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmettes\"Palmettes\").[\\[27\\]](#cite_note-27) The roofs were covered with Pentelic marble tiles. The building had some of the optical refinements of the Parthenon: inward inclination and [entasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entasis\"Entasis\") of the columns and curvature of the architrave.[\\[28\\]](#cite_note-28) However, the stylobate had no curvature. Some of its parts also shared the proportions with the Parthenon. For instance, the general ratio used was 3:7, very similar to the ratio of 4:9 used for the Parthenon.[\\[29\\]](#cite_note-29)\\n\\n[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Pedestal_of_the_statue_of_Hygieia.jpg/220px-Pedestal_of_the_statue_of_Hygieia.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pedestal_of_the_statue_of_Hygieia.jpg)\\n\\nPedestal of the statue of Hygieia\\n\\nThe building features no decorative or architectural sculpture; all metopes and pediments were left empty and there were no [akroteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acroterion\"Acroterion\").[\\[30\\]](#cite_note-30) Nonetheless, a number of freestanding shrines and votives stood in the vicinity of the Propylaia, and have come to be associated with it if only by virtue of Pausanias' description of them and their proximity to the building. In the western precinct, there was the Hermes Propylaios by [Alkamenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkamenes\"Alkamenes\"), which stood on the north end of the entrance.[\\[31\\]](#cite_note-31) Similarly, a relief of the [Graces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charites\"Charites\"), made by Sokrates (the Boeotian sculptor active around 450 BCE), stood on the south of the entrance. In the east precinct, the bronze statue of Diotrephes, an Athenian general killed in combat in Boeotia during the [Peloponnesian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnesian_War\"PeloponnesianWar\"), stood behind the second column from the south. The statue of Aphrodite made by Kalamis and dedicated by Kallias stood behind the second column from the north. The Leaina (an Archaic bronze lioness) stood near the north wall. A votive column carrying a young rooster probably stood along the south wall. A small shrine dedicated to Athena Hygieia was erected against the southernmost column on the eastern facade soon after 430 BCE.[\\[32\\]](#cite_note-32) Though accounts differ, this last shrine might have been erected to thank Athena for the end of the [great plague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_of_Athens\"PlagueofAthens\").[\\[33\\]](#cite_note-33)\\n\\nPinakotheke\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Propylaia_(Acropolis_of_Athens)&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Pinakotheke\")\\]\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/The_Doric_columns_of_the_Propylaea_of_Athens_on_March_5%2C_2020.jpg/220px-The_Doric_columns_of_the_Propylaea_of_Athens_on_March_5%2C_2020.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Doric_columns_of_the_Propylaea_of_Athens_on_March_5,_2020.jpg)\\n\\nThe Pinakotheke (left)\\n\\n[Pausanias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pausanias_(geographer) \"Pausanias (geographer)\") records that the inner compartment of the north-east wing was used to display paintings; he calls it οἴκημα ἔχον γραφάς, \"a chamber with paintings\",[\\[34\\]](#cite_note-34) and describes a number of works by masters of the fifth century. By Pausanias' time the picture gallery had been in existence for several centuries, so the Hellenistic historian [Polemon of Ilion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polemon_of_Athens\"PolemonofAthens\") had written a, now lost, book entitled Περὶ τῶν ἐντοῖς Προπυλαίοις πινάκων (On the Panel Paintings in the Propylaia) which might have been an influence on the later writer.[\\[35\\]](#cite_note-35) Satyros, writing in the third century, described two panels dedicated by [Alkibiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkibiades\"Alkibiades\") after his victories in the chariot race at Olympia and Nemea.[\\[36\\]](#cite_note-36) Also, a painting depicting Diomedes and Odysseus taking the [Palladion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palladion\"Palladion\") from [Troy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy\"Troy\"), and the painting depicting Achilles on Skyros, painted by [Polygnotos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygnotos\"Polygnotos\") around 450 BCE. On the basis of these references, modern writers have frequently called the building the Pinakotheke, but there is no ancient authority for that epithet and no reason to believe the building was intended to be a picture gallery.\\n\\nOne particular problem posed by the northwest wing has been to explain the asymmetric placement of the doorway and windows in the front wall behind the colonnade.[\\[37\\]](#cite_note-37) It was [John Travlos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Travlos\"JohnTravlos\") who first observed that in the placement of its door the chamber resembled Greek banqueting rooms, both the [androns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andron_(architecture) \"Andron (architecture)\") of private houses and the larger dining halls associated with sanctuaries.[\\[38\\]](#cite_note-38) His demonstration that seventeen dining couches could be placed end to end around the four walls of the room has become the consensus view, and the idea has been developed further to explain the intended function of the four subsidiary halls of the Propylaia in the original plan as banqueting facilities for the city’s high officials after the sacrifices at the Panathenaic festival.[\\[39\\]](#cite_note-39) Though this argument remains speculative.\\n\\nReception and influence\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Propylaia_(Acropolis_of_Athens)&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Reception and influence\")\\]\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/A_view_of_the_Propyl%C3%A9a_and_the_two_contiguous_buildings_in_their_present_state%2C_taken_from_the_situation_of_the_little_-_Stuart_James_%26_Revett_Nicholas_-_1787.jpg/220px-thumbnail.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:A_view_of_the_Propyl%C3%A9a_and_the_two_contiguous_buildings_in_their_present_state,_taken_from_the_situation_of_the_little_-_Stuart_James_%26_Revett_Nicholas_-_1787.jpg)\\n\\nPropylaia in the late 18th century[\\[40\\]](#cite_note-40)\\n\\nDespite being unfinished the Propylaia was admired in its own time.

This revealing passage not only equates the Parthenon and gatehouse in significance but associates them with the heroic past.[\\[41\\]](#cite_note-41) His political rival [Aeschines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeschines\"Aeschines\") also made laudatory reference to the Propylaia when on the [Pnyx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pnyx\"Pnyx\") he invited the demos to gaze on the gates and recall Salamis.[\\[42\\]](#cite_note-42) It wasn't only the object of approbation, however, [Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero\"Cicero\") in his [De Officiis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Officiis\"DeOfficiis\") 2.60 (citing [Demetrios of Phaleron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demetrios_of_Phaleron\"DemetriosofPhaleron\")) critiques the financial profligacy of the building.\\n\\nThe first documentary evidence of the Propylaia from the early modern period is Niccolò di Martoni's account of 1395 which indicated that the Beulé Gate was not in use at this point but the entrance to the Acropolis was still through the Propylaia. In the following centuries the only information on the building is from traveller's reports or the diaries of military officers. Attempts to survey the building begin in earnest in the late eighteenth century, notably [J.-D. Le Roy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julien-David_Le_Roy\"Julien-DavidLeRoy\")'s _Ruines des plus beaux monuments de la Gréce_ 1758, and [Stuart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_%22Athenian%22_Stuart\"James\"Athenian\"Stuart\") and [Revett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Revett\"NicholasRevett\")'s _The Antiquities of Athens_ 1762-1804, but are hampered by the spolia and overbuilding on the structure. Subsequent studies include Bohn's fundamental work _Die Propyläen der Akropolis zu Athen_ 1882 which summarized our knowledge of the building prior to the archaeological discoveries of 1885-1890; Bundgaard's _Mnesicles, A Greek Architect at Work_ 1957 that examined the building's implications for planning practice; Dinsmoor Jr., _The Propylaia I: The Predecessors_ 1980, careful study of the predecessors of the Propylaea. Since 1975? has been subject to ongoing restoration work under T. Tanoulas whose work has been published by the Acropolis Restoration Service as _Μελέτη αποκαταστάσεως των Προπυλαίων_ (Study for the Restoration of the Propylaea) 1994.\\n\\nPerhaps the two most notable examples of the Propylaia's architectural influence are the Greater Propylaia at [Eleusis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusis\"Eleusis\") and [Langhans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gotthard_Langhans\"CarlGotthardLanghans\")'s [Brandenburg Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_Gate\"BrandenburgGate\") of 1791. The former was a Roman [Neo-Attic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Attic\"Neo-Attic\") copy of the Central Hall at Athens from the late second century CE, probably instigated by [Hadrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian\"Hadrian\").[\\[43\\]](#cite_note-43) This was framed by two memorial arches in what was possibly a reference to the wings of the original building.[\\[44\\]](#cite_note-44) The latter, while an inexact copy, is clearly informed by the Athenian original likely drawing on Le Roy’s work, then the only reference source before the publication of _The Antiquities of Athens_. Commissioned by the King of Prussia, the Gate inaugurated the [Greek Revival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Revival_architecture\"GreekRevivalarchitecture\") in Germany even though the edifice deviated notably from the canonical Doric form; its frieze ends with a half-metope and its columns have bases.[\\[45\\]](#cite_note-45)\\n\\nNotes\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Propylaia_(Acropolis_of_Athens)&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Notes\")\\]\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n1.  **[^](#cite_ref-1)** P.

some just see a blur\\n\\nYuri Arcurs/Alamy\\n\\nOur ability to perceive rapid changes in visual scenes over time – our “speed of sight” – varies a surprising amount between people, according to the

contribute to people’s different abilities in sports like baseball and cricket, says [Clinton Haarlem](https://www.tcd.ie/Zoology/research/groups/jackson/members/clinton-haarlem.php) at Trinity

From Oklahoma City to Indiana to this Sacramento stop that has gone so well [since he arrived in February 2022](https://theathletic.com/3511396/2022/02/08/kings-finalize-6-player-trade-to-acquire-domantas-sabonis-tyrese-haliburton-buddy-hield-to-pacers/), with three All-Star berths in between and combined earnings that will surpass $282 million by the end of his current contract, Sabonis has harbored fears of an [NBA](https://theathletic.com/nba/) fallout that should have faded by now. Especially, one might incorrectly assume, after his latest stellar season in which he was dominant and dynamic enough to finish seventh in MVP voting.\\n\\nSo when the 27-year-old spent last summer ramping up his training like never before, inviting [Sacramento Kings](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/sac-kings/) assistant coach Doug Christie to lead his offseason regimen near his homes in Napa, Calif., and Los Angeles while the big man overhauled his diet as a way to increase his strength, no one within his inner circle was surprised. Once he healed up from all the bumps and ([Draymond Green](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/draymond-green-qWchQbJAR0YQNMyV/)–[caused](https://theathletic.com/4423463/2023/04/18/warriors-kings-game-2-score-draymond-green/)) bruises that came with that physical first-round playoff loss to the [Golden State Warriors](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/warriors/), and with the Kings having decided to give him a five-year, $217 million extension that would secure his status as a massive piece of their revived program, he turned his attention to the annual summertime task of proving his worth. Again.\\n\\n“I always feel that way,” Sabonis told _The Athletic_ with a self-aware chuckle in a recent phone interview. “My wife doesn’t like my mentality sometimes. But I’m always thinking that way — not of the worst (case-scenario), but like, ‘What if it ended today?’ Or ‘What if this or that happened?’ So I’ve gotta do the most (possible with his time).\\n\\n“There’s a lot to get to work on. I know the numbers may show otherwise, but I feel like there’s so much left where I can help my teammates on the court and win games. That’s exciting as a player. Like, if I work on this, and I can do this in this situation, then that’s going to help the team. I’m always thinking of that.”\\n\\nThe question this week, as Sabonis is well aware, is what the NBA head coaches who pick All-Star reserves might be thinking.\\n\\nThose numbers that Sabonis alluded to are even better this season than last, as he’s averaging 19.9 points, a league-leading 12.7 rebounds and a team-leading 8.0 assists for this Kings team (26-18) that is fifth in the Western Conference (he averaged 19.1, a league-leading 12.3 rebounds and 7.3 assists in the 2022-23 campaign and was voted third-team All-NBA). The [only other players averaging anywhere near a triple-double](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional?CF=PTS*GE*10:REB*GE*8:AST*GE*7&dir=-1&sort=W) this season, per NBA.com/stats, are the [Denver Nuggets’](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/nuggets/) [Nikola Jokić](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/nikola-jokic-bCjsyLGuQMrMSWNr/)  and the [Dallas Mavericks’](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/mavericks/) [Luka Dončić](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/luka-doncic-gMyReUOesjAikT7S/). Yet still, it seems, Sabonis’ foreboding vibe remains.\\n\\nHis perspective was no doubt shaped by his [legendary Lithuanian father, Arvydas,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF8aCCt0aw0) whose best playing days came overseas before he finally joined the Portland Trail Blazers as a 30-year-old. His father’s journey was far different — and remarkable, really — with his ill-fated NBA delay caused by everything from the Soviet Union’s [Iron Curtain that blocked him from coming to America](https://www.deseret.com/1996/5/4/19240276/what-ifs-abound-when-contemplating-sabonis) to injuries that forever changed the arc of his career. His story remains one of the great “What-ifs?” in NBA lore.\\n\\nAll these decades later, Domantas has a deep appreciation for his basketball life that was formed out of his family history.\\n\\n“That desperation to stay over here (in the NBA vs. playing in Europe) because I love it, and try to get better, I don’t think that’s gonna change,” Sabonis said. “My family and friends always laugh at me, like, ‘Oh, you’re always gonna want more, or to keep going.’ They always know. There’s no calm time with me.”\\n\\n_(The following interview has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.)_\\n\\n**So from a timeline standpoint, the Warriors series ends in late April, and you take a bit to recover from there. When did you and Doug start the offseason routine?** \\n\\nWe met with the (Kings) guys in Napa like a month after the season. We all got together, went to a winery, had dinner. It was the whole team, basically. We stayed at [Stanly Ranch](https://aubergeresorts.com/stanlyranch/). And yeah, a day or two after that is when I started getting back to work. I couldn’t do much at first because of my thumb.\\n\\n_After suffering a fracture in his right thumb in late December, Sabonis chose against having surgery and instead_ [_played through the injury_](https://theathletic.com/4042348/2022/12/29/domantas-sabonis-thumb-injury-nba-sacramento-kings/) _for the rest of the season._\\n\\nSo we were doing all this rehab for it to get it right, and I couldn’t do contact or anything, so it was just dribbling, and I slowly built into it. With Jas (Randhawa, the Kings’ senior director of athlete health), we had a whole lifting program. I really wanted to get my body right. I’m an undersized big, and I play physical, but I still wanted to be stronger when you play against the bigger guys, to really be able to hold my ground and be more effective.\\n\\n**So what did you change?**\\n\\nWell, I usually always try to add or try new things. I want to keep trying to be better, especially while I’m still young. I always start at 6 a.m., but this year, I have my two kids, so I’d make sure I started at 6 a.m., and I’m done by maybe 11, 11:30, so then I get like an hour and a half with the kids before they have their naptime so I’m not fully gone for half of the day during the season (Domantas and his wife, Shashana Rosen, had their second child, and first daughter, in March). I changed my diet to help me. I did a test where they show you all of your things that you’re sensitive to.\\n\\n**And what did you learn?**\\n\\nI learned that everything I love I couldn’t eat (laughs). So it definitely was hard. It was hard. I get to do my test again after six months, and usually they say that everything you eat, a lot your body gets adapted to it, so hopefully the things I love that I’ve cut out, when I redo this test, some things might pop back up that I’m allowed to eat again.\\n\\nNo carbs, like wheat. I had to go gluten free. I can’t do gluten-free pasta, and I love Italian food. There’s a lot of carbs in my diet, so I had to basically cut most of them out in terms of pasta, bread. I love croissants, pastries, all that stuff. Those would be my cheat meals. So I have to stay away from that. But I actually didn’t lose weight. I actually gained weight, which is the craziest thing. I just have like no body fat now. … The weight is still there — 248 to 250 (pounds). That’s where I stay at during the season. But the body fat is completely down. It wasn’t high before, but now it’s like nothing.\\n\\nThat’s definitely helped me. I feel lighter. I don’t get as tired on the court. I wake up better. So I did all those things that the tests showed me, and that definitely had an impact. I have kids now, so that means less naptime. But I feel great. And I love to nap, so I always thought that was gonna be an issue, but it definitely hasn’t been.\\n\\n![Image 1](https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/01/28194417/USATSI_20561935-scaled.jpg)\\n\\nDomantas Sabonis and Doug Christie talk before a playoff game in April against the Warriors. (Darren Yamashita / USA Today)\\n\\n**Let’s go back to the basketball part of the program. What did that look like?**\\n\\nWe just really worked on everything that teams are going to give up on me (defensively), ways that I can get guys more open, more involved, situations where I usually passed up on (opportunities) sometimes to get the offense flowing and whatnot. Sometimes I could be open, but it’s like, “OK, this is where I have to get (Kings forward) Keegan (Murray) the ball or (guard) Kevin (Huerter) the ball,” to get them going so the whole offense clicks. We worked on situations where, if I need to be more aggressive, I have options to go to. We worked on the right hand a lot, and the jump shooting of course. We just really focused on those things, and Doug’s been great. He’s been showing me film on all these little things that we could add. Honestly, I feel like there’s still a lot of room to improve. I always feel like there’s more. It’s kind of hard to add things. It was a tough summer, because when you’re ranked the No. 1 offense in history, there’s not much more to add, you know what I mean?\\n\\n_While the Kings’ offensive rating of 118.6 last season was the best in league history, they’re currently 12th (117; [Indiana](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/pacers/) has the top mark at 121.2)._\\n\\nYou don’t want to do too much. Maybe that’s what our struggles were in the beginning (of the season) with our offense. Everyone came back and wanted to add more, you know? And everyone had career years (last season). But with an offense like this, you can’t really add more. Everyone knows their role, and you just got to be more efficient, basically.\\n\\nI think we’ve definitely showed strides in the last 10 games, even though the record hasn’t shown it, but offensively, we’ve done better. The ball has been hopping more, guys have been shooting more confidently. Playing the Warriors ([in a 134-133 win on Thursday](https://theathletic.com/5229249/2024/01/26/harrison-barnes-kings-warriors-recap/)) helps because they’re a really fast team, so it kind of got us back into that flow again. But yeah, we’ll see. We’ll see as the games go on.\\n\\n**So paint the picture of your training setup in Napa.** \\n\\nWell I usually spend time in Napa, and then the other half was in L.A. (after). In Napa, I have a home gym, in terms of a weight room, and then I have a (basketball) gym down the hill from my house like two minutes away. It’s a high school. They’re super nice. It’s a connection I have. They let us come in whenever we want. And we come in early. It’s easy. Doug would basically live out in Napa with me in the summer. I would work out Monday through Friday; Saturday and Sundays would be off. Anytime I wanted to go at night to shoot or whatever, and the gym is right there, they would let me. We basically had our own key. It was basically like our own gym. So that was pretty sweet. And building the weight room out at home was the best thing ever, because that’s like two hours of your day that I’m at home and kids and the fam can come in and can join. It’s just easy. I’m not gone for so long, you know?\\n\\nWith Doug, it’s very natural. We can be ourselves. He’s been a player. I respect him as a player and a person, so it really just flows easy. And then once (Kings assistant coach Leandro) Barbosa came, having him helped a lot more too because that’s a guard who still can play. I played against him in FIBA competitions. We can play ones, and then when any other teammate came to work out with me this summer we could do two-on-two. (Barbosa) is a full player. He’s aggressive, really good on defense. So that would really help me out on those more physical, smaller guys when they go through switching situations. We definitely thought about it all and just went through everything. And Doug is crazy with his methods, so every day was a different crazy drill. If people saw what I was doing , they’d be like, “What is this?” Special type of finishes, dribbling exercises. Every day, he would just switch it up, so he would just keep it exciting and fun.”\\n\\n**OK, I need to know more about these drills…**\\n\\nDifferent finishes off one foot, off the wrong foot, having bands involved. He’s just pushing me. I get bumped a lot when I go up, so it was learning how to finish in those areas. When I shoot, they’re closing out or using a stick, one of those fluffy sticks, hitting me on my legs because, when you shoot, sometimes you get scared you’re gonna step on the ankle. So it’s trying to block all that out and just focus on your shot. Sitting in chairs, finishes with the right hand in a chair under the rim, which is really hard. Standing up in a chair and using heavy balls, big balls, small balls. (Christie) is into all that, and I really trust him. I just go with his flow and really try to learn. At the end of the day, you’re feeling the ball. You get to control the ball. It depends how serious you take the exercise if it’s actually going to help or not, so I went all in with Doug.\\n\\n**I know you gotta get on the road, so I’ll let you get out. As far as your team right now, you all are learning the hard way how the shift from surprise Cinderella team to being a team with expectations can be tough. Is the spotlight hitting you differently this season? What has that dynamic been like for you?** \\n\\nIt’s tough to say, because our record isn’t what we think it can be. But we know we’ve dropped a lot of games where we’ve had full control. Just in this last week, the [Phoenix](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/suns/) and the [Milwaukee](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/bucks/) (losses), those would have been two wins where we would have been up in fourth or fifth (place) or whatever it is, you know? It’s tough, because we know we are better. We’ve shown it. We just sometimes go through these mental lapses in games, which are very, very controllable. We know that. There’s other games where we’ve controlled it and ended up winning the game. So we’ve just got to stay mentally strong. We need to win games to get the best seed as we can for the playoffs, but I feel like, as the year goes on, we’re learning more and more, you know? We’re seeing film, seeing what we do wrong.\\n\\nWe’re realizing these things. And the good thing is that we still have another 40 games. But it’s not going to get easier. It’s only gonna get harder as the year goes on because everyone’s fighting for this position. So it’s more about mental toughness for us.\\n\\n_(Top photo of Domantas Sabonis: Ezra Shaw / Getty Images)_\\n

Built around 420 BCE, the [temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple\"Temple\") is the earliest fully [Ionic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_order\"Ionicorder\") temple on the Acropolis. It has a prominent position on a steep bastion at the south west corner of the Acropolis to the right of the entrance, the [Propylaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propylaea_(Acropolis_of_Athens) \"Propylaea (Acropolis of Athens)\"). In contrast to the Acropolis proper, a walled sanctuary entered through the Propylaea, the Victory Sanctuary was open, entered from the Propylaea's southwest wing and from a narrow stair on the north. The sheer walls of its bastion were protected on the north, west, and south by the _Nike Parapet_, named for its frieze of Nikai celebrating victory and sacrificing to their patroness, [Athena and Nike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena\"Athena\").\\n\\n[Nike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike_(mythology) \"Nike (mythology)\") was the goddess of victory in [Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language\"Greeklanguage\"), and Athena was worshipped in this form, representative of being victorious in war. The citizens worshipped the goddesses in hopes of a successful outcome in the long [Peloponnesian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnesian_War\"PeloponnesianWar\") fought against the [Spartans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta\"Sparta\") and allies.[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-:1-1)\\n\\nHistory\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_of_Athena_Nike&action=edit&section=1\"Editsection:History\")\\]\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Acropolis_Athens_BM_424.jpg/220px-Acropolis_Athens_BM_424.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Acropolis_Athens_BM_424.jpg)\\n\\nScene of the [Battle of Plataea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Plataea\"BattleofPlataea\"), from the south frieze of the Temple of Athena Nike, [British Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Museum\"BritishMuseum\") (London)\\n\\n[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Propylaea_and_Temple_of_Athena_Nike_at_the_Acropolis_%28Pierer%29.jpg/220px-Propylaea_and_Temple_of_Athena_Nike_at_the_Acropolis_%28Pierer%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Propylaea_and_Temple_of_Athena_Nike_at_the_Acropolis_(Pierer).jpg)\\n\\nTemple of Athena Nike is on the right from the Propylaea\\n\\nThe cult of Athena Nike was operable in the early sixth century BCE. On the remains of a Mycenaean bastion, a cult image of Athena seated holding a pomegranate in her right hand and holding a helmet in her left was placed on top of a square limestone base. The Sanctuary of Athena Nike was demolished by the Persians in 480-479 BCE and a temple was built over the remains.[\\[2\\]](#cite_note-:0-2) The new temple construction was underway in 449 BCE and was finished around 420 BCE. The cult was supervised by the [Priestess of Athena Nike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priestess_of_Athena_Nike\"PriestessofAthenaNike\"), who was appointed through democratic allotment.[\\[1\\]](#cite_note-:1-1) If still in use by the 4th-century, the temple would have been closed during the [persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_pagans_in_the_late_Roman_Empire\"PersecutionofpagansinthelateRomanEmpire\").\\n\\nAthens fell to the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire\"OttomanEmpire\") in 1456. The temple sat untouched until it was demolished in 1686 by the Ottomans who used the stones to build defenses. In 1834 the temple was reconstructed after the independence of Greece. In 1998 the temple was dismantled so that the crumbling concrete floor could be replaced and its frieze was removed and placed in the new [Acropolis Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acropolis_Museum\"AcropolisMuseum\") that opened in 2009.[\\[3\\]](#cite_note-3) The Temple of Athena Nike is often closed to visitors as work continues. The new museum exhibit consists of fragments of the site before the [Persians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persians\"Persians\") were thought to have destroyed it in 480 BCE. Sculptures from the friezes have been salvaged such as: deeds of Hercules, statue of Moscophoros, a damaged sculpture of a goddess credited to Praxiteles and the Rampin horseman, as well as epigraphic dedications, decrees, and stelae.[\\[4\\]](#cite_note-4)\\n\\nArchitecture\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_of_Athena_Nike&action=edit&section=2\"Editsection:Architecture\")\\]\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Temple-of-Athena-Nike-Plan.gif/220px-Temple-of-Athena-Nike-Plan.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Temple-of-Athena-Nike-Plan.gif)\\n\\nFloor plan\\n\\nThe Temple of Athena Nike was finished around 420 BCE,[\\[5\\]](#cite_note-5) during the [Peace of Nicias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Nicias\"PeaceofNicias\"). It is a _[tetrastyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrastyle\"Tetrastyle\")_ (four [column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column\"Column\")) [Ionic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_order\"Ionicorder\") structure with a [colonnaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonnade\"Colonnade\") [portico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portico\"Portico\") at both front and rear [facades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade\"Facade\") (_[amphiprostyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphiprostyle\"Amphiprostyle\")_), designed by the [architect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architect\"Architect\") [Kallikrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kallikrates\"Kallikrates\"). The columns along the east and west fronts were monolithic columns. The temple ran 8 metres (26 feet) long by 5.5 metres (18 feet) wide and 7 metres (23 feet) tall. The total height from the [stylobate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylobate\"Stylobate\") to the acme of the [pediment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediment\"Pediment\") while the temple remained intact was a modest 7 metres (23 feet). The ratio of height to diameter of the columns is 7:1, rather than the more standard 9:1 or 10:1 ratio in Ionic buildings. Constructed from white [Pentelic marble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentelic_marble\"Pentelicmarble\"), it was built in stages as war-starved funding allowed.\\n\\n[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/ACMA_973_Nik%C3%A8_sandale_1.JPG/170px-ACMA_973_Nik%C3%A8_sandale_1.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ACMA_973_Nik%C3%A8_sandale_1.JPG)\\n\\nA relief from the parapet around the temple which shows [Nike fixing her sandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike_fixing_her_sandal\"Nikefixinghersandal\").

The orientation of the temple is set up so that the East Frieze sits above the entrance of the temple on the porch side. The north frieze depicted a battle between Greeks entailing cavalry. The south frieze showed the decisive victory over the Persians at the [battle of Plataea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Plataea\"BattleofPlataea\"). The east frieze showed an assembly of the gods [Athena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena\"Athena\"), [Zeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus\"Zeus\") and [Poseidon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poseidon\"Poseidon\"), rendering Athenian religious beliefs and reverence for the gods bound up in the social and political climate of 5th Century Athens. The west frieze has a good amount of the original sculpting preserved. Similar to the east frieze it is most likely telling the story of a battle, or more specifically a victory. There are multiple corpses depicted (more than any of the other three friezes) and imagery of one about to be killed with some figures wearing helmets. This battle between armies most likely is depicting the massacre of the Corinthians by the Athenians.[\\[6\\]](#cite_note-6)\\n\\nSome time after the temple was completed, around 410 BCE a [parapet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parapet\"Parapet\") was added around it to prevent people from falling from the steep [bastion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion\"Bastion\"). The outside of the parapet was adorned by carved relief sculptures showing Nike in a variety of activities, including two Nikai setting up a trophy, and all in procession.[\\[7\\]](#cite_note-7)\\n\\nArchitects [Christian Hansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Hansen_(architect) \"Christian Hansen (architect)\") and Eduard Schaubert excavated the temple in the 1830s. The building had been totally dismantled in the 17th century and the stone built into the Turkish wall that surrounded the hill. A primitive [anastylosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastylosis\"Anastylosis\") was carried out in 1836 when the temple was re-erected from remaining parts. A third restoration was completed in Summer 2010.[\\[8\\]](#cite_note-8) The main structure, [stylobate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylobate\"Stylobate\") and columns are largely intact, minus the roof and most of the [tympanae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediment\"Pediment\"). Fragments of the sculpted frieze are exhibited in the [Acropolis Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acropolis_Museum\"AcropolisMuseum\") and the [British Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Museum\"BritishMuseum\"); copies of these are fixed in their place on the temple.\\n\\n### Parapet of Nike\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_of_Athena_Nike&action=edit&section=5\"Editsection:ParapetofNike\")\\]\\n\\nOn the parapet, there would have stood a famous marble statue of a wingless Nike. The positioning of this statue has Nike leaning towards her right foot with her right arm stretching towards her sandal and her clothes slipping off her shoulder. For a while, there has been much debate over what the imagery of this statue is supposed to represent. There are many other uses of Greek sandal-related art found on cups, vases, and even on the friezes of the Parthenon. However, these versions all depict the subjects bending down with both arms stretched out to adjust or tie their sandals. The difference in imagery between one hand and two is what has caused discrepancy behind the meaning of the statue of a wingless Nike. It is most likely that Nike is instead removing or loosening her sandal as opposed to adjusting or putting it on. This use of imagery is thought to be used to demonstrate the action of removing footwear to those entering the temple to pay tribute to Athena, as this was a traditional action of worshiping in this space.[\\[9\\]](#cite_note-9) The statue was discovered in 1835 near the temple. It is thought to have stood on the south side of the temple. It is currently held by the Acropolis Museum (inventory number Ακρ. 973).[\\[10\\]](#cite_note-10)\\n\\nThe famous parapet of Nike removing her sandal is an example of [wet drapery](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wet_drapery&action=edit&redlink=1\"Wetdrapery(pagedoesnotexist)\").[\\[11\\]](#cite_note-11) Wet drapery involves showing the form of the body but also concealing the body with the drapery of the clothing. Some friezes are from the Persian and Peloponnesian wars. The friezes contained a cavalry scene from the battle of Marathon and a Greek victory over the Persians at the battle of Plataea. The battles represent Greek and Athenian dominance through military power and historical events.[\\[12\\]](#cite_note-:3-12) A statue of Nike stood in the _[cella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cella\"Cella\")_, or otherwise referred to as a _naos_. Nike was originally the \"winged victory\" goddess (_see_ the winged [Nike of Samothrace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike_of_Samothrace\"NikeofSamothrace\")). The Athena Nike statue's absence of wings led Athenians in later centuries to call it _Apteros Nike_ or wingless victory, and the story arose that the statue was deprived of wings so that it could never leave the city.\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Acropolis._Beul%C3%A9_Gate._Propylaea._Temple_Nike.jpg/220px-Acropolis._Beul%C3%A9_Gate._Propylaea._Temple_Nike.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Acropolis._Beul%C3%A9_Gate._Propylaea._Temple_Nike.jpg)\\n\\nAn 1893 photograph of the Acropolis showing the [Beulé Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beul%C3%A9_Gate\"BeuléGate\"), Propylaea and the Temple of Athena Nike\\n\\nCornice and cyma\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_of_Athena_Nike&action=edit&section=6\"Editsection:Corniceandcyma\")\\]\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n### Cornice\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_of_Athena_Nike&action=edit&section=7\"Editsection:Cornice\")\\]\\n\\nThe cornice follows standard architectural design and sits immediately above the frieze and wraps around the entire structure. Many sections of the cornice that have been discovered are believed to be part of the Temple of Athena Nike, however, some archaeologists think that some of the pieces found near the temple might not be part it. These pieces of the cornice are lined on the inside with an array of holes, supporting the idea that the cornice was held in place by dowels, which connected it to the frieze. Many of these cornice pieces are so weathered and worn that the dowel holes are no longer visible.[\\[12\\]](#cite_note-:3-12)\\n\\nThe cornice stretches flat and with no moldings that would create a design. If there had been a design, it would not be sculptural. There is evidence that would suggest that the cornice would have at one point been painted. However, because the architecture has been worn for such a long time, any knowledge of what the design could have been is long lost.\\n\\n### Cyma\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_of_Athena_Nike&action=edit&section=8\"Editsection:Cyma\")\\]\\n\\nJust above the cornice, on the north and south sides of the temple, rests the cyma. They sit at an angle on both sides, creating the slope that makes up the roofing and the pediment. Stretching along the cyma is an order of lion heads that extend outward. At each end of the cyma, where the corners would turn into the east and west faces of the temple, there are cuttings just above the cyma where an akroteria would have been placed.[\\[12\\]](#cite_note-:3-12)\\n\\nAkroteria\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_of_Athena_Nike&action=edit&section=9\"Editsection:Akroteria\")\\]\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe main body of the central statue that made up the akroteria was composed of bronze, not marble. There is evidence of gold foiling and gold wiring through the main bronze core. Researchers have hypothesized on the form of the statue, but there is no trace of the original sculpture to indicate what the central akroteria really looked like. The same can be said for the statues that would make up the east and west akroteria. Both were made of bronze and it is impossible to know what the figures could have been. Theories around the figure of the central statue include the winged horse [Pegasus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus\"Pegasus\") or the monster [Chimera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(mythology) \"Chimera (mythology)\").[\\[2\\]](#cite_note-:0-2) However, these theories may be unlikely as the proportions of these animals’ bodies would not match where their feet would be placed in the akroteria's base block.[\\[13\\]](#cite_note-:4-13)\\n\\n### Statue theories\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_of_Athena_Nike&action=edit&section=10\"Editsection:Statuetheories\")\\]\\n\\nA possible theory for the central akroteria would be a bronze tripod, similar to the ones that would have been on the Temple of Zeus in Olympia. This hypothesis has not been discredited for a few reasons: 1) It would be a realistic answer for the shape of the statue since the tripods dimensions would fit in the cuttings of the supporting block (unlike the animal theories). 2) A tripod would have been a likely statue to have a bronze core when serving as an acroteria. 3) The Tripod is commonly used as a symbol of victory.\\n\\nA commemorative trophy is another theory for the central akroteria that has yet to be disproven for many of the same reasons as the tripod. There are also some sculptures on the surrounding parapets that depict Nike setting up a trophy.\\n\\nThe last theory that has yet to be discredited is a central akroteria of a flying Nike. The idea is that a statue of a winged Nike would have been set just above a shield and on either side of her would have stood a Nikai holding weapons dedicated to the goddess. The akroteria at the temple of Zeus in Olympia would be a good statue for comparison with the exception of the two Nikai. This shape for the central akroteria would explain the cuttings in the supporting block that would not have matched with some of the other forms.[\\[13\\]](#cite_note-:4-13)\\n\\nSee also\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_of_Athena_Nike&action=edit&section=11\"Editsection:Seealso\")\\]\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n*   [List of Ancient Greek temples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ancient_Greek_temples\"ListofAncientGreektemples\")\\n*   [Architecture of Ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_Ancient_Greece\"ArchitectureofAncientGreece\")\\n*   [Art of Ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_of_Ancient_Greece\"ArtofAncientGreece\")\\n*   [Classical architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_architecture\"Classicalarchitecture\")\\n*   [Classical sculpture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_sculpture\"Classicalsculpture\")\\n\\nReferences\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_of_Athena_Nike&action=edit&section=12\"Editsection:References\")\\]\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n### Sources\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_of_Athena_Nike&action=edit&section=13\"Editsection:Sources\")\\]\\n\\n*   _Greek architecture_ [Encyclopædia Britannica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica\"EncyclopædiaBritannica\"), 1968.\\n*   _Greece: From Mycenae to the Parthenon_, Henri Stierlin, [TASCHEN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taschen\"Taschen\"), 2004.\\n\\n### Footnotes\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_of_Athena_Nike&action=edit&section=14\"Editsection:Footnotes\")\\]\\n\\n1.  ^ [_**a**_](#cite_ref-:1_1-0) [_**b**_](#cite_ref-:1_1-1) Connelly, Joan Breton, Portrait of a priestess: women and ritual in ancient Greece, Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, 2007\\n2.  ^ [_**a**_](#cite_ref-:0_2-0) [_**b**_](#cite_ref-:0_2-1) STEWART, ANDREW F.

It is important to consider the microhabitats and landscapes that shape the cultures and traditions we inherit. Some regions have been occupied for many millennia, resulting in a long history with no breaks or gaps in the chronology. However, there are some examples in archaeology of sites that have been occupied for a long time but have had gaps in occupation; the infamous site of [Hastinapura](https://theprint.in/opinion/bihars-chirand-has-a-4000-year-history-its-the-rising-sun-of-indias-neolithic-culture/1954039/blank) is a prime example of such chrono-cultural history.\\n\\nThere are also examples of a region with multiple sites deciphering the story of continuity and change, the classical example of this would be the sites of [Mehrgarh](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b7x6xx), [Nausharo](https://theprint.in/opinion/bihars-chirand-has-a-4000-year-history-its-the-rising-sun-of-indias-neolithic-culture/1954039/blank) and [Pirak](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/11263509609439562), together showcasing the evolution of culture from early farming to the Bronze Age. Therefore, it is not necessary that an individual site will have to give an entire picture of the region’s historicity; there can be multiple sites in a region that can offer you a glimpse of shifts in the cultural paradigm.\\n\\n[Chirand,](https://ehrafarchaeology.yale.edu/traditions/aq50/documents/010) an archaeological site in Bihar, is a combination of these two distinct examples. The site narrates a regional evolution of society from the Neolithic to the Early Historical period after which it was deserted till the Mediaeval period. But when combined with other sites on the banks of the Ganga, such as [Maner](https://www.telegraphindia.com/bihar/new-year-date-for-maner-excavation-archaeologists-expect-to-find-artefacts-dating-back-to-neolithic-age-and-pal-period/cid/349766), [Chechar](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/relics-of-india-s-golden-age-discovered-in-bihar/story-UFBBSlznIEiQpdjvxLqzRN.html) and Senuar, it provides valuable information on the over-4000-year history of the region.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n_**Also Read:** [Is there a ‘void’ in Indian history? Brahmagiri, Maski hold the answer](https://theprint.in/opinion/is-there-a-void-in-indian-history-brahmagiri-maski-hold-the-answer/1933821/)  \\n_\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### **The Rising Sun of Bihar**\\n\\nOnce called the ‘rising sun of the neolithic culture in India’ by archaeologist [FR Allchin](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bulletin-of-the-school-of-oriental-and-african-studies/article/abs/f-r-allchin-piklihal-excavations-andhra-pradesh-government-archaeological-series-no-1-xvii-154-pp-64-plates-hyderabad-government-of-andhra-pradesh-1960-rs-15/899F551FD0CA064CBCB51E995001D146), Chirand is an archaeological site located in the Saran district of Bihar. The site was first reported after a surface study in the late 1800s— when Mediaeval structures and Buddhist sculptures were found. The initial excavations, conducted in 1962 by the Directorate of Archaeology and Museum, Bihar, lasted for seven field seasons till 1972-73.\\n\\nA five-fold cultural sequence was revealed during the excavation which was broadly categorised as –\\n\\n**Period I** – Neolithic (early food-producing period)\\n\\n**Period II** – Chalcolithic (Copper-using society)\\n\\n**Period III** – Northern Black Polished Ware-associated culture (linked with the rise of ancient republics)\\n\\n**Period IV**– Historical period (from 1st century to 3rd century BCE)\\n\\n**Period V**– Late Historical\\n\\nThe neolithic society at Chirand settled on the alluvial deposit of the Ganga River in circular houses made of wild reeds. A circular floor about four metres in diameter with a series of open hearths, a few post-holes near the floor and a few burnt chunks of clay with a reed impression are valuable pieces of evidence that speak volumes about neolithic settlement style and social matrix.\\n\\nBone tools, styli, tanged and socketed arrowheads, bangles of ivory and tortoise bone, and many bone ornaments from the Neolithic phase are indicative of a highly skilled society which focused on utilising animal bones in many ways. Apart from this, beads made of chalcedony, agate, jasper, marble, chert, steatite and faience—which were sources from across the subcontinent—link the settlers of Chirand to the domestic trade matrix. Material like faience must be the result of exchange with the Harappans in the west, whereas agate was probably coming from Gujarat.\\n\\nThe evidence of rice, wheat, barley and masoor [at Chirand](https://ehrafarchaeology.yale.edu/traditions/aq50/documents/008) suggests that people, during Period I, were cultivating cereals and legumes. Fish also was part of their diet.\\n\\nSuch a complex society of early farmers in eastern India at around c.2400 BCE is a marker of indigenous growth of culture, which is connected to its contemporary settlements around Chirand and across the Ganga in the west.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n_**Also Read:** [Calling Harappan Civilisation ‘Vedic Saraswati’ is extreme—learn to hold a trowel first](https://theprint.in/opinion/calling-harappan-civilisation-vedic-saraswati-is-extreme-learn-to-hold-a-trowel-first/1914084/)_\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### **Evolution to copper**\\n\\nThe inclusion of metal is a sign of evolution, both of society and of technology. Copper was the first metal which slowly penetrated the social fabric i[n Chirand.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44145448) This brought about the onset of the Chalcolithic period.\\n\\nThe early dates of the Copper Age—which succeeded the early farming period and paved the way for iron—come from the western half of the subcontinent. But this may be a generalised statement because the juncture when the Neolithic ends and Chalcolithic begins might not follow a linear pattern in every microcosm. It can merge in the initial stages before paving the way for a full-fledged Copper Age, just like at [Maski](https://theprint.in/opinion/is-there-a-void-in-indian-history-brahmagiri-maski-hold-the-answer/1933821/), Karnataka. Moreover, in some instances, they co-exist, as we have seen in the case of [Burzahom](https://theprint.in/opinion/buzahom-can-change-story-of-evolution-until-recently-it-was-a-kashmiri-t20-cricket-ground/1474410/) and Harappa.\\n\\nIn the case of Chirand, both scenarios stand true. At the site, the Neolithic period slowly transitions into the Chalcolithic period. But when placing the site with its contemporary sites in the same region as Maner, the [Neolithic period of Chirand](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44145448) co-exists with the Chalcolithic period of Maner which is dated to 2600 BCE.\\n\\nThe Chalcolithic period in Chirand is dated around c.2000 to 1950 BCE and covers about 5.5m thickness of the total deposit. The copper-using people lived in houses made of reeds and bamboo with mud plaster and floors made of burnt earth. Circular hearths are noted in the earliest levels of the deposit. Secondary burials were also recorded during the excavation.\\n\\nBone tools continue to make an appearance along with stone beads. A few corroded pieces of copper were excavated along with a few pear-shaped terracotta beads.\\n\\nThis phase slowly merges into Period III— the Iron Age.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n_**Also Read:** [Archaeological tourism is on the rise. Govt to citizens, India must learn to handle the sites](https://theprint.in/opinion/heritage-tourism-has-moved-to-archaeology-but-indians-havent-learnt-good-practices-yet/1870345/)_\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### **Towards urbanism**\\xa0\\n\\nIf copper marked the evolution of society and a technological shift in metallurgy, iron is credited with leading the society into urbanism. The Iron Age in the subcontinent is a much-debated topic. While the exact date of the introduction of iron is still debatable, its inclusion in the material culture is considered important— so much so that early scholars called the Iron Age the foundation of second urbanism in India.\\n\\nAt [Chirand](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44145448), the introduction of iron is coupled with the presence of Northern Black Polish Ware which, like iron, is a product of advanced kilning technique. Iron implements found at the site include sickles, axes, ploughshares, daggers, lances, knife blades, etc. Beads of semi-precious stones and terracotta beads are also part of the material assemblage at the site. Terracotta human and animal figures including the naga figurine are important findings. Copper antimony rods, bone arrowheads, copper-punch marked coins and cast coins were also found during this period. What is interesting is that Neolithic celts \\\\[a tool from the period\\\\] were also present in this period. A drastic change in settlement pattern was in the building material. Baked brick structures start to appear, with mud walls and rammed floors. Period III was followed by Period IV—from 1st century BCE to 3rd century CE—which was ruled by the Kushana dynasty. During this period big residential complexes and monastic buildings are reported. Several structural phases are noted, one of which included remnants of a monastic kitchen which yielded a terracotta torso of Hariti. An important discovery of this period was the Kushana copper coin hoard of 88 coins, and a terracotta sealing with the early Brahmi script. Period V is the last phase which revealed that the site was deserted after 3rd century CE and reoccupied after a considerable gap during the late historical and early Mediaeval period. The periodisation is indicated by the recovery of a pot with five gold coins of the Kalachuri dynasty ruler Gangeyadeva dated c.1045 CE, and the presence of an unidentified sculpture from the Pala period. ### **Continuity and change** At [Brahmagiri](https://theprint.in/opinion/is-there-a-void-in-indian-history-brahmagiri-maski-hold-the-answer/1933821/) and [Maski](https://theprint.in/opinion/is-there-a-void-in-indian-history-brahmagiri-maski-hold-the-answer/1933821/), cultures changed and the landscape evolved with time. Similarly, at Chirand, early neolithic farmers co-existed and evolved alongside the copper-using society, and at the same time distinctively showed how easily cultures change and merge at one location. From humble wattle and daub structures emerged rammed floors, community hearths, and burnt bricks, changing the settlement style which eventually became the hallmark of urbanism. The Kushana occupation that follows, is also an example of how the region, and most importantly Chirand itself, is [significant](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44145448) – perhaps due to political reasons or maybe just due to trade.\\n\\n[Today](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/famous-archaeological-site-in-bihar-faces-threat-of-erosion-101624801867323.html), Chirand is rapidly being consumed by the Ganga, recently fresh excavations opened up a glorious chapter of the history of eastern India, leaving us waiting for more data.\\n\\n_An earlier version of this article wrongly identified an archaeological site as Chirand.

They were about to watch history in the making, the teacher would tell them. The kids would then stare as an orange shroud spread across the sky. “I remember the clouds coming over our town and writing our names in the dust,” she said [in an interview](https://collections.lib.utah.edu/ark:/87278/s6hq8s4r) with Justin Sorensen, a geographical information systems (GIS) specialist at the University of Utah’s J. Willard Marriott Library.\\n\\nThat dust had traveled around 200 miles, all the way from what is now called the Nevada National Security Site, where scientists once tested nuclear weapons. Between 1945 and 1962, U.S. researchers [detonated](https://www.osti.gov/opennet/manhattan-project-history/publications/DOENuclearTests.pdf) around 200 bombs aboveground—100 of them in Nevada. Fallout from the nuclear tests—radioactive particles that were swept into the atmosphere and fell back down to the earth—found their way into crops and livestock, whose radioactivity humans took on when they consumed milk, meat and produce. Fallout takes many different chemical forms, one of which is iodine-131: an isotope, or version, of iodine that has the usual 53 protons but 78 neutrons instead of the standard 74. Inside the body, the thyroid gland will absorb iodine-131, which eventually decays to produce radiation that can causethyroid cancer and other problems.\\n\\nPeople, such as Walsh, who lived “downwind” of nuclear development and open-air explosions are now called “downwinders.” Mary Dickson, another downwinder, [told Sorensen and one of his colleagues](https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=1246432&q) that she thought the attitude toward those in Utah who were affected by nuclear testing was, “you know, ‘They were Mormons and cowboys and Indians—who cares?’ In general, she added, “they test where they think there are populations that don’t matter.”\\n\\nSorensen and his team spoke to both women and dozens of other people for a project called the Downwinders of Utah Archive. Hosted by the J. Willard Marriott Library, the archive is an attempt to qualify, quantify and make accessible people’s experiences of, and effects from, the American legacy of nuclear weapons testing. In 2011 the Senate unanimously designated January 27 as the National Day of Remembrance for Downwinders. “The downwinders paid a high price for the development of a nuclear weapons program for the benefit of the United States,” [stated](https://www.congress.gov/112/bills/sres330/BILLS-112sres330ats.pdf) the resolution establishing the designation.\\n\\nBut when the tests were conducted, no one had done the research necessary to truly calculate what that price would be. Wanting to understand the potential link between regional health issues and fallout from nuclear tests, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) undertook [a study](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/i131-report-and-appendix) on Americans exposed to iodine-131 from the Nevada tests. [The results](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/i131-report-and-appendix) were released in 1997 in a report entitled “Estimated Exposures and Thyroid Doses Received by the American People from Iodine-131 in Fallout following Nevada Atmospheric Nuclear Bomb Tests.” It was this document that first led Sorensen to the archival project. “We were just kind of wondering, originally, ‘What does this data look like if you put it on a map?’” he says, “because a spreadsheet doesn’t really tell you a lot.” Sorensen’s background is in GIS and cartography, so he took the NCI’s fallout data and overlaid them onto his home state. “It just really grew from there,” he says. “We started seeing there's a story to be told.”\\n\\nThat story, Sorensen knew, included individual human narratives. So he and his team used their maps to pinpoint hotspots in the Beehive State. Advertising in heavily dosed places, such as St. George and Cedar City, the archivists asked people to come to their local libraries and share their experiences. “We came back with 30-plus interviews,” Sorensen says.\\n\\nSome interviewees told Sorensen of men who examined their thyroids or of the potassium iodide pills teachers passed out to combat the effects of radiation. Dickson recalled watching public-information films starring [Bert the Turtle](https://www.loc.gov/static/programs/national-film-preservation-board/documents/duck_cover.pdf), who taught kids to duck and cover in the event of a nuclear explosion. The film, though, was not really a warning about what your own country might do inside its borders.\\n\\nAlongside the interviews, Sorensen collected hard geospatial data and analysis. Web visitors to his archive can survey [iodine fallout maps](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9U0T4P-RpilbWdQSDg1c3ZqUFk/view?resourcekey=0-OvI6LYYD0t-7furhCq6tMQ), [diagrams of mushroom-cloud heights for different test series](https://sites.google.com/site/projectstorage2015/downwinders-screenshots/Operation%20Teapot%20Cloud%20Height%20Diagram.jpg), animations of nuclear [air drops](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9U0T4P-RpilTUxjMmhJREgtR3c/view?resourcekey=0-JDDveE0Hx-XygDkKes3f_A), [milk consumption statistics](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-EnaKGTzTEsA/VVS6uA6SFhI/AAAAAAAADSM/Y4DtDANUBwg/w1279-h959-no/Average%2BMilk%2BProduction%2B%2526%2BConsumption%2BNumbers%2Bfor%2B1954.png) from when contaminated cows passed their burden on and an [interactive timeline](https://lib.utah.edu/services/geospatial/downwinders/) of the explosive atomic age. “I was really surprised just how closely and accurately the interviews match the data,” Sorensen says. In particular, he cites a test in the Operation Upshot-Knothole series. Later the test was nicknamed “[Dirty Harry](https://www.ctbto.org/specials/testing-times/19-may-1953-dirty-harry/)” because it generated more fallout than any other continental boom, much of which ended up near St. George. “You hear this firsthand, and it brings all the information together,” he says.\\n\\nAlthough no single illness can be conclusively tied to a test-site cause, investigations by the [United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation](http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/gareport.pdf) and the [International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War and the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research](https://ieer.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/1991/06/RadioactiveHeavenEarth1991.pdf), among others, have established links between radiation exposure and cancer occurrence. In the early 2000s a [report](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/fallout/) by NCI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that fallout could have led to around [11,000 excess deaths](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/fallout/feasibilitystudy/Technical_Vol_1_Chapter_4.pdf). The NCI has also created [a calculator](https://radiationcalculators.cancer.gov/fallout/) that allows users to calculate their thyroid dose and risk of developing thyroid cancer from fallout. “We can’t know any individual’s cancer was caused by radioactivity,” explains Scott Williams, former executive director of HEAL Utah, a nonprofit advocacy group focused on the environment and public health, “but we do know that some people’s cancer risk was increased by radioactivity.”\\n\\nSince 1990 the federal government has offered some recompense to downwinders and others affected by nuclear testing through the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA). Set to expire this summer unless [a bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2798) is passed to renew (and expand) it, RECA pays downwinders, test participants and uranium workers between $50,000 and $100,000—if they have specific ailments and can prove (with decades-old evidence that is sometimes hard to come by) they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. “We left a burden on unwitting citizens across the country without ever informing them,” Williams says. “We need to do the honorable thing and own the problem and not create these problems again.”\\n\\nThe Downwinders of Utah Archive is always expanding, and though Sorensen paused interviews during the pandemic, he plans to light the fuse again soon. He also hopes to expand the project to other Western states to preserve their history, too.\\n\\nMaking sure that information remains accessible is part of the point of the Downwinders of Utah Archive. The day of remembrance is, in its own way, an isotope of that openness. “Those kind of markers are really important...,” Dickson told Sorensen and his colleague. “Otherwise, you know, time marches on, and it’s like dipping a big spoon in the water.

It was a monumental practice session, one of the few that matched Jaiswal\\'s long sessions,\" Bharucha revealed.\\n\\nA day in a Test match has 90 overs, which is 540 balls plus extras, but 140 overs is effectively 840 deliveries in a single day. How was that even possible?\\n\\nBharucha explained the process.\\n\\n\"All (bowlers and throwdown men) are standing there at the same time. And the sequence is one throws for the flick. Next one for the cut. Next one for the pull. Next one for the straight drive. We do this on multiple surfaces (spinning, grass, bounce, wet cement), with multiple types of balls (rubber, tennis, cricket) and multiple types of bats (heavy/light/thin etc).\\n\\n\"Within this also we have one bunch who do it with the hand and the next bunch who do it with the wanger (throwdown apparatus Roboarm). Behind them are the spinners, and behind them the fast bowlers.\\n\\n\"So, one round in the nets would comprise around 14 people throwing, wanging and bowling, as opposed to the traditional way, where you may have like three spinners and three fast bowlers (for example) bowling one round.\\n\\n\"That\\'s how we got through 140 overs in a day\\'s practice for Dhruv,\" he said.\\n\\nBharucha explained the need for young batters to practice \\'sequencing\\' where they know that no two deliveries will be same, and that\\'s how the batter prepares for all eventualities.\\n\\n\"The discussion before this innings with Dhruv was \\'go down to the level of your practice and everything will be fine\\'. The talk is always about staying hungry.\\n\\n\"Like Jaiswal did to Anderson. First flick into the on-side, then you know you are forcing the bowler to bowl outside off, so let\\'s be prepared to attack him in that region (six over cover). Then he can\\'t bowl outside off or outside leg.\\n\\n\"So you can attack him straight down the ground (six down the ground). All our practice is set up in this manner. No two balls will land in the same spot during our drills. We even have our set throwers who are named Flick, Cut, Pull, Drive. It\\'s funny but our boys loved it.\"\\n\\nDestiny does play a role for people who are destined to achieve great things. It was Jurel\\'s U19 and UP teammate Kartik Tyagi who recommended him for Rajasthan Royals trials.\\n\\nFunnily, there was another batter-keeper, an U19 World Cup winner (2018) named Aryan Juyal, who also did well in trials and scouts were a bit confused.\\n\\nBut Bharucha always knew whom they were signing.\\n\\n\"I remembered him (Jurel) hitting this one ball over extra cover for an enormous six and thought this looked different and special. Even our own RR selection team was confused which player we were going after.\\n\\n\"But I requested them to check the video of the guy who hit that six over extra cover and they came back saying it was Dhruv Jurel. I was very clear that\\'s the one RR should be chasing come the auction day.\"\\n\\n(Published\\n\\n25 February 2024, 13:03\\n\\nIST)\\n\\nFollow us on\\n------------\\n\\n[Read More](#)\\n'}, {'sender': 'Shardul Vaidya', 'link_value': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propylaia_(Acropolis_of_Athens)', 'plaintext_content': None, 'timestamp': Timestamp('2024-05-01 00:35:00'), 'link_jina': 'https://r.jina.ai/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propylaia_(Acropolis_of_Athens)', 'link_content': 'Title: Propylaia (Acropolis of Athens)\\n\\nURL Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propylaia_(Acropolis_of_Athens)\\n\\nPublished Time: 2019-12-18T03:31:29Z\\n\\nMarkdown Content:\\n[![Image 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/East_Facade_of_the_Propylaea_on_July_23%2C_2019.jpg/300px-East_Facade_of_the_Propylaea_on_July_23%2C_2019.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:East_Facade_of_the_Propylaea_on_July_23,_2019.jpg)\\n\\nPropylaia east façade\\n\\nThe **Propylaia** ([Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language\"Greeklanguage\"): Προπύλαια; lit.\\u2009\\'Gates\\') is the classical Greek [Doric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doric_order\"Doricorder\") building complex that functioned as the monumental ceremonial gateway to the [Acropolis of Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acropolis_of_Athens\"AcropolisofAthens\"). Built between 437 and 432 BCE as a part of the [Periklean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles\"Pericles\") Building Program, it was the last in a series of gatehouses built on the citadel.

The only easily accessible pathway to the plateau lies between what is now the bastion of the [Temple of Athena Nike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Athena_Nike\"TempleofAthenaNike\") and the terrace of the [Agrippa Monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestal_of_Agrippa\"PedestalofAgrippa\"). In [Mycenaean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helladic_chronology\"Helladicchronology\") times the bastion (also referred to as the pyrgos or tower) was encased in a [cyclopean wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclopean_wall\"Cyclopeanwall\"), and amongst the few Mycenaean structures left in the archaeological record is a substantial wall on the terrace of the bastion that was part of the system of fortifications of the Acropolis.[\\\\[2\\\\]](#cite_note-2) This wall must have terminated at the first gateway, though opinions differ on the reconstruction of this earliest entrance.[\\\\[3\\\\]](#cite_note-3) At some point in the archaic period a ramp replaced the bedrock pathway; the buttress wall on the north side of the existing stairway is from this period.[\\\\[4\\\\]](#cite_note-4) This was followed shortly after [Marathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Marathon\"BattleofMarathon\") by a programme of renovation on the Acropolis including the replacement of the gateway with a ceremonial entrance, usually referred to as the Older Propylon, and the refurbishment of the forecourt in front of it.[\\\\[5\\\\]](#cite_note-5) At this time, a section of the western [Bronze Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age\"BronzeAge\") wall, south of the gateway, received a marble lining on its western face and an integrated base at the northern extent for a _[perirrhanterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Perirrhanterion&action=edit&redlink=1\"Perirrhanterion(pagedoesnotexist)\")_, or lustral basin.

From the socket for the roof beam and the spur walls on the north and south flanks of the central hall it can be discerned that the original plan was for a much larger building than its final form.[\\\\[9\\\\]](#cite_note-9) Mnesikles had planned a gatehouse composed of five halls: a central hall that would be the processional route to the Acropolis, two perpendicular flanking halls – north and south of the central hall – that would have spanned the whole width of the western end of the plateau, and two further, eastward projecting halls that were at 90 degrees to the north-south halls. Of these only the central hall, the north-east hall (the Pinakotheke) and a truncated version of the south-east hall reached completion. Furthermore, it is evident from the adaption of the [stylobate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylobate\"Stylobate\") that a stepped platform was added to the interior of the central hall such that the western-most [tympanum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tympanum_(architecture) \"Tympanum (architecture)\") and roof were raised above the rest of the building. The reasons for these alterations have been the cause of much speculation. They include practical considerations of the site,[\\\\[10\\\\]](#cite_note-10) religious objections to the displacement of the adjoining shrines,[\\\\[11\\\\]](#cite_note-11) and cost.[\\\\[12\\\\]](#cite_note-12) Whatever the reason it is clear that the project was abandoned in an unfinished state in 432 with the lifting bosses remaining and the surface of the [ashlar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashlar\"Ashlar\") blocks left undressed.\\n\\n[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Fachada_este%2C_Propileos%2C_Atenas%2C_Grecia%2C_2019_03.jpg/220px-Fachada_este%2C_Propileos%2C_Atenas%2C_Grecia%2C_2019_03.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fachada_este,_Propileos,_Atenas,_Grecia,_2019_03.jpg)\\n\\n\"Lifting bosses\"[\\\\[13\\\\]](#cite_note-13) on the Propylaia\\n\\nAlterations to the Propylaia in the classical period were slight,[\\\\[14\\\\]](#cite_note-14) the most significant being the construction of a monumental stairway in [pentelic marble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Pentelicus#Pentelic_marble\"MountPentelicus\") built in the reign of [Claudius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius\"Claudius\"), probably 42 CE, and arranged as a straight flight of steps.[\\\\[15\\\\]](#cite_note-15) This included a central inclined plane along which the sacrificial animals could be led, also a small [dog-leg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog-leg_(stairs) \"Dog-leg (stairs)\") stairway on the Nike bastion that led to the Temple of Athena Nike.

Beyond this is the archaic ramp leading to the zig-zag Mnesiklean ramp that remains today. Immediately ahead is the U-shaped structure of the central hall and eastward wings. The central hall is a [hexastyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexastyle\"Hexastyle\") Doric [pronaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronaos\"Pronaos\") whose central intercolumniation is spaced one [triglyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyph\"Triglyph\") and one [metope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metope\"Metope\") wider than the others. This central pathway, which leads through to the plateau, passes under a double row of [Ionic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_order\"Ionicorder\") columns the capitals of which are orientated north-south, and is axially parallel with the [Parthenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenon\"Parthenon\"). The westward-projecting wings are attached to the central hall by way of a tristyle in antis Doric colonnade of a scale two-thirds of that of the central hall. The [crepidoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crepidoma\"Crepidoma\") of the wings is in the canonical three-step form and in Pentelic marble, but the last course of the [euthynteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthynteria\"Euthynteria\") below is in a contrasting blue Eleusian limestone. The [orthostates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthostates\"Orthostates\") of the two wings were also made of dark Eleusinian limestone, this visual continuity was maintained with the orthostates of the central hall and the top step on the interior flight of stairs all constructed in the same limestone.[\\\\[26\\\\]](#cite_note-26) The interior of the Central Hall is divided by a wall in which there are five doorways symmetrically arranged; the eponymous gates. The ceilings were supported by marble beams (about 6 m long) and the innermost squares of the [coffers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffer\"Coffer\") (Doric and Ionic coffers were both used) were decorated either with golden stars on a blue field with a bright green margin or an arrangement of [palmettes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmettes\"Palmettes\").[\\\\[27\\\\]](#cite_note-27) The roofs were covered with Pentelic marble tiles. The building had some of the optical refinements of the Parthenon: inward inclination and [entasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entasis\"Entasis\") of the columns and curvature of the architrave.[\\\\[28\\\\]](#cite_note-28) However, the stylobate had no curvature. Some of its parts also shared the proportions with the Parthenon. For instance, the general ratio used was 3:7, very similar to the ratio of 4:9 used for the Parthenon.[\\\\[29\\\\]](#cite_note-29)\\n\\n[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Pedestal_of_the_statue_of_Hygieia.jpg/220px-Pedestal_of_the_statue_of_Hygieia.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pedestal_of_the_statue_of_Hygieia.jpg)\\n\\nPedestal of the statue of Hygieia\\n\\nThe building features no decorative or architectural sculpture; all metopes and pediments were left empty and there were no [akroteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acroterion\"Acroterion\").[\\\\[30\\\\]](#cite_note-30) Nonetheless, a number of freestanding shrines and votives stood in the vicinity of the Propylaia, and have come to be associated with it if only by virtue of Pausanias\\' description of them and their proximity to the building. In the western precinct, there was the Hermes Propylaios by [Alkamenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkamenes\"Alkamenes\"), which stood on the north end of the entrance.[\\\\[31\\\\]](#cite_note-31) Similarly, a relief of the [Graces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charites\"Charites\"), made by Sokrates (the Boeotian sculptor active around 450 BCE), stood on the south of the entrance. In the east precinct, the bronze statue of Diotrephes, an Athenian general killed in combat in Boeotia during the [Peloponnesian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnesian_War\"PeloponnesianWar\"), stood behind the second column from the south. The statue of Aphrodite made by Kalamis and dedicated by Kallias stood behind the second column from the north. The Leaina (an Archaic bronze lioness) stood near the north wall. A votive column carrying a young rooster probably stood along the south wall. A small shrine dedicated to Athena Hygieia was erected against the southernmost column on the eastern facade soon after 430 BCE.[\\\\[32\\\\]](#cite_note-32) Though accounts differ, this last shrine might have been erected to thank Athena for the end of the [great plague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_of_Athens\"PlagueofAthens\").[\\\\[33\\\\]](#cite_note-33)\\n\\nPinakotheke\\\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Propylaia_(Acropolis_of_Athens)&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Pinakotheke\")\\\\]\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/The_Doric_columns_of_the_Propylaea_of_Athens_on_March_5%2C_2020.jpg/220px-The_Doric_columns_of_the_Propylaea_of_Athens_on_March_5%2C_2020.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Doric_columns_of_the_Propylaea_of_Athens_on_March_5,_2020.jpg)\\n\\nThe Pinakotheke (left)\\n\\n[Pausanias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pausanias_(geographer) \"Pausanias (geographer)\") records that the inner compartment of the north-east wing was used to display paintings; he calls it οἴκημα ἔχον γραφάς, \"a chamber with paintings\",[\\\\[34\\\\]](#cite_note-34) and describes a number of works by masters of the fifth century. By Pausanias\\' time the picture gallery had been in existence for several centuries, so the Hellenistic historian [Polemon of Ilion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polemon_of_Athens\"PolemonofAthens\") had written a, now lost, book entitled Περὶ τῶν ἐντοῖς Προπυλαίοις πινάκων (On the Panel Paintings in the Propylaia) which might have been an influence on the later writer.[\\\\[35\\\\]](#cite_note-35) Satyros, writing in the third century, described two panels dedicated by [Alkibiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkibiades\"Alkibiades\") after his victories in the chariot race at Olympia and Nemea.[\\\\[36\\\\]](#cite_note-36) Also, a painting depicting Diomedes and Odysseus taking the [Palladion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palladion\"Palladion\") from [Troy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy\"Troy\"), and the painting depicting Achilles on Skyros, painted by [Polygnotos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygnotos\"Polygnotos\") around 450 BCE. On the basis of these references, modern writers have frequently called the building the Pinakotheke, but there is no ancient authority for that epithet and no reason to believe the building was intended to be a picture gallery.\\n\\nOne particular problem posed by the northwest wing has been to explain the asymmetric placement of the doorway and windows in the front wall behind the colonnade.[\\\\[37\\\\]](#cite_note-37) It was [John Travlos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Travlos\"JohnTravlos\") who first observed that in the placement of its door the chamber resembled Greek banqueting rooms, both the [androns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andron_(architecture) \"Andron (architecture)\") of private houses and the larger dining halls associated with sanctuaries.[\\\\[38\\\\]](#cite_note-38) His demonstration that seventeen dining couches could be placed end to end around the four walls of the room has become the consensus view, and the idea has been developed further to explain the intended function of the four subsidiary halls of the Propylaia in the original plan as banqueting facilities for the city’s high officials after the sacrifices at the Panathenaic festival.[\\\\[39\\\\]](#cite_note-39) Though this argument remains speculative.\\n\\nReception and influence\\\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Propylaia_(Acropolis_of_Athens)&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Reception and influence\")\\\\]\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/A_view_of_the_Propyl%C3%A9a_and_the_two_contiguous_buildings_in_their_present_state%2C_taken_from_the_situation_of_the_little_-_Stuart_James_%26_Revett_Nicholas_-_1787.jpg/220px-thumbnail.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:A_view_of_the_Propyl%C3%A9a_and_the_two_contiguous_buildings_in_their_present_state,_taken_from_the_situation_of_the_little_-_Stuart_James_%26_Revett_Nicholas_-_1787.jpg)\\n\\nPropylaia in the late 18th century[\\\\[40\\\\]](#cite_note-40)\\n\\nDespite being unfinished the Propylaia was admired in its own time.

In the following centuries the only information on the building is from traveller\\'s reports or the diaries of military officers. Attempts to survey the building begin in earnest in the late eighteenth century, notably [J.-D.

Subsequent studies include Bohn\\'s fundamental work _Die Propyläen der Akropolis zu Athen_ 1882 which summarized our knowledge of the building prior to the archaeological discoveries of 1885-1890; Bundgaard\\'s _Mnesicles, A Greek Architect at Work_ 1957 that examined the building\\'s implications for planning practice; Dinsmoor Jr., _The Propylaia I: The Predecessors_ 1980, careful study of the predecessors of the Propylaea.

don’t tell him that\\n\\nURL Source: https://theathletic.com/5233957/2024/01/29/sacramento-kings-domantas-sabonis-interview/\\n\\nPublished Time: 2024-01-29T11:00:03.000Z\\n\\nMarkdown Content:\\n[Domantas Sabonis](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/domantas-sabonis-P1iXY4NkyOp3D6Vw/) is slightly paranoid.\\n\\nTalk to those who know him best, and you’ll learn all about the disproportionate desperation that has driven him for all these years. From Oklahoma City to Indiana to this Sacramento stop that has gone so well [since he arrived in February 2022](https://theathletic.com/3511396/2022/02/08/kings-finalize-6-player-trade-to-acquire-domantas-sabonis-tyrese-haliburton-buddy-hield-to-pacers/), with three All-Star berths in between and combined earnings that will surpass $282 million by the end of his current contract, Sabonis has harbored fears of an [NBA](https://theathletic.com/nba/) fallout that should have faded by now. Especially, one might incorrectly assume, after his latest stellar season in which he was dominant and dynamic enough to finish seventh in MVP voting.\\n\\nSo when the 27-year-old spent last summer ramping up his training like never before, inviting [Sacramento Kings](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/sac-kings/) assistant coach Doug Christie to lead his offseason regimen near his homes in Napa, Calif., and Los Angeles while the big man overhauled his diet as a way to increase his strength, no one within his inner circle was surprised. Once he healed up from all the bumps and ([Draymond Green](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/draymond-green-qWchQbJAR0YQNMyV/)–[caused](https://theathletic.com/4423463/2023/04/18/warriors-kings-game-2-score-draymond-green/)) bruises that came with that physical first-round playoff loss to the [Golden State Warriors](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/warriors/), and with the Kings having decided to give him a five-year, $217 million extension that would secure his status as a massive piece of their revived program, he turned his attention to the annual summertime task of proving his worth. Again.\\n\\n“I always feel that way,” Sabonis told _The Athletic_ with a self-aware chuckle in a recent phone interview. “My wife doesn’t like my mentality sometimes. But I’m always thinking that way — not of the worst (case-scenario), but like, ‘What if it ended today?’ Or ‘What if this or that happened?’ So I’ve gotta do the most (possible with his time).\\n\\n“There’s a lot to get to work on. I know the numbers may show otherwise, but I feel like there’s so much left where I can help my teammates on the court and win games. That’s exciting as a player. Like, if I work on this, and I can do this in this situation, then that’s going to help the team. I’m always thinking of that.”\\n\\nThe question this week, as Sabonis is well aware, is what the NBA head coaches who pick All-Star reserves might be thinking.\\n\\nThose numbers that Sabonis alluded to are even better this season than last, as he’s averaging 19.9 points, a league-leading 12.7 rebounds and a team-leading 8.0 assists for this Kings team (26-18) that is fifth in the Western Conference (he averaged 19.1, a league-leading 12.3 rebounds and 7.3 assists in the 2022-23 campaign and was voted third-team All-NBA). The [only other players averaging anywhere near a triple-double](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional?CF=PTS*GE*10:REB*GE*8:AST*GE*7&dir=-1&sort=W) this season, per NBA.com/stats, are the [Denver Nuggets’](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/nuggets/) [Nikola Jokić](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/nikola-jokic-bCjsyLGuQMrMSWNr/)\\xa0 and the [Dallas Mavericks’](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/mavericks/) [Luka Dončić](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/luka-doncic-gMyReUOesjAikT7S/). Yet still, it seems, Sabonis’ foreboding vibe remains.\\n\\nHis perspective was no doubt shaped by his [legendary Lithuanian father, Arvydas,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF8aCCt0aw0) whose best playing days came overseas before he finally joined the Portland Trail Blazers as a 30-year-old. His father’s journey was far different — and remarkable, really — with his ill-fated NBA delay caused by everything from the Soviet Union’s [Iron Curtain that blocked him from coming to America](https://www.deseret.com/1996/5/4/19240276/what-ifs-abound-when-contemplating-sabonis) to injuries that forever changed the arc of his career. His story remains one of the great “What-ifs?” in NBA lore.\\n\\nAll these decades later, Domantas has a deep appreciation for his basketball life that was formed out of his family history.\\n\\n“That desperation to stay over here (in the NBA vs. playing in Europe) because I love it, and try to get better, I don’t think that’s gonna change,” Sabonis said. “My family and friends always laugh at me, like, ‘Oh, you’re always gonna want more, or to keep going.’ They always know. There’s no calm time with me.”\\n\\n_(The following interview has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.)_\\n\\n**So from a timeline standpoint, the Warriors series ends in late April, and you take a bit to recover from there. When did you and Doug start the offseason routine?**\\xa0\\n\\nWe met with the (Kings) guys in Napa like a month after the season. We all got together, went to a winery, had dinner. It was the whole team, basically. We stayed at [Stanly Ranch](https://aubergeresorts.com/stanlyranch/). And yeah, a day or two after that is when I started getting back to work. I couldn’t do much at first because of my thumb.\\n\\n_After suffering a fracture in his right thumb in late December, Sabonis chose against having surgery and instead_ [_played through the injury_](https://theathletic.com/4042348/2022/12/29/domantas-sabonis-thumb-injury-nba-sacramento-kings/) _for the rest of the season._\\n\\nSo we were doing all this rehab for it to get it right, and I couldn’t do contact or anything, so it was just dribbling, and I slowly built into it. With Jas (Randhawa, the Kings’ senior director of athlete health), we had a whole lifting program. I really wanted to get my body right. I’m an undersized big, and I play physical, but I still wanted to be stronger when you play against the bigger guys, to really be able to hold my ground and be more effective.\\n\\n**So what did you change?**\\n\\nWell, I usually always try to add or try new things. I want to keep trying to be better, especially while I’m still young. I always start at 6 a.m., but this year, I have my two kids, so I’d make sure I started at 6 a.m., and I’m done by maybe 11, 11:30, so then I get like an hour and a half with the kids before they have their naptime so I’m not fully gone for half of the day during the season (Domantas and his wife, Shashana Rosen, had their second child, and first daughter, in March). I changed my diet to help me. I did a test where they show you all of your things that you’re sensitive to.\\n\\n**And what did you learn?**\\n\\nI learned that everything I love I couldn’t eat (laughs). So it definitely was hard. It was hard. I get to do my test again after six months, and usually they say that everything you eat, a lot your body gets adapted to it, so hopefully the things I love that I’ve cut out, when I redo this test, some things might pop back up that I’m allowed to eat again.\\n\\nNo carbs, like wheat. I had to go gluten free. I can’t do gluten-free pasta, and I love Italian food. There’s a lot of carbs in my diet, so I had to basically cut most of them out in terms of pasta, bread. I love croissants, pastries, all that stuff. Those would be my cheat meals. So I have to stay away from that. But I actually didn’t lose weight. I actually gained weight, which is the craziest thing. I just have like no body fat now. … The weight is still there — 248 to 250 (pounds). That’s where I stay at during the season. But the body fat is completely down. It wasn’t high before, but now it’s like nothing.\\n\\nThat’s definitely helped me. I feel lighter. I don’t get as tired on the court. I wake up better. So I did all those things that the tests showed me, and that definitely had an impact. I have kids now, so that means less naptime. But I feel great. And I love to nap, so I always thought that was gonna be an issue, but it definitely hasn’t been.\\n\\n![Image 1](https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/01/28194417/USATSI_20561935-scaled.jpg)\\n\\nDomantas Sabonis and Doug Christie talk before a playoff game in April against the Warriors. (Darren Yamashita / USA Today)\\n\\n**Let’s go back to the basketball part of the program. What did that look like?**\\n\\nWe just really worked on everything that teams are going to give up on me (defensively), ways that I can get guys more open, more involved, situations where I usually passed up on (opportunities) sometimes to get the offense flowing and whatnot. Sometimes I could be open, but it’s like, “OK, this is where I have to get (Kings forward) Keegan (Murray) the ball or (guard) Kevin (Huerter) the ball,” to get them going so the whole offense clicks. We worked on situations where, if I need to be more aggressive, I have options to go to. We worked on the right hand a lot, and the jump shooting of course. We just really focused on those things, and Doug’s been great. He’s been showing me film on all these little things that we could add. Honestly, I feel like there’s still a lot of room to improve. I always feel like there’s more. It’s kind of hard to add things. It was a tough summer, because when you’re ranked the No. 1 offense in history, there’s not much more to add, you know what I mean?\\n\\n_While the Kings’ offensive rating of 118.6 last season was the best in league history, they’re currently 12th (117; [Indiana](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/pacers/) has the top mark at 121.2)._\\n\\nYou don’t want to do too much. Maybe that’s what our struggles were in the beginning (of the season) with our offense. Everyone came back and wanted to add more, you know? And everyone had career years (last season). But with an offense like this, you can’t really add more. Everyone knows their role, and you just got to be more efficient, basically.\\n\\nI think we’ve definitely showed strides in the last 10 games, even though the record hasn’t shown it, but offensively, we’ve done better. The ball has been hopping more, guys have been shooting more confidently. Playing the Warriors ([in a 134-133 win on Thursday](https://theathletic.com/5229249/2024/01/26/harrison-barnes-kings-warriors-recap/)) helps because they’re a really fast team, so it kind of got us back into that flow again. But yeah, we’ll see. We’ll see as the games go on.\\n\\n**So paint the picture of your training setup in Napa.**\\xa0\\n\\nWell I usually spend time in Napa, and then the other half was in L.A. (after). In Napa, I have a home gym, in terms of a weight room, and then I have a (basketball) gym down the hill from my house like two minutes away. It’s a high school. They’re super nice. It’s a connection I have. They let us come in whenever we want. And we come in early. It’s easy. Doug would basically live out in Napa with me in the summer. I would work out Monday through Friday; Saturday and Sundays would be off. Anytime I wanted to go at night to shoot or whatever, and the gym is right there, they would let me. We basically had our own key. It was basically like our own gym. So that was pretty sweet. And building the weight room out at home was the best thing ever, because that’s like two hours of your day that I’m at home and kids and the fam can come in and can join. It’s just easy. I’m not gone for so long, you know?\\n\\nWith Doug, it’s very natural. We can be ourselves. He’s been a player. I respect him as a player and a person, so it really just flows easy. And then once (Kings assistant coach Leandro) Barbosa came, having him helped a lot more too because that’s a guard who still can play. I played against him in FIBA competitions. We can play ones, and then when any other teammate came to work out with me this summer we could do two-on-two. (Barbosa) is a full player. He’s aggressive, really good on defense. So that would really help me out on those more physical, smaller guys when they go through switching situations. We definitely thought about it all and just went through everything. And Doug is crazy with his methods, so every day was a different crazy drill. If people saw what I was doing , they’d be like, “What is this?” Special type of finishes, dribbling exercises. Every day, he would just switch it up, so he would just keep it exciting and fun.”\\n\\n**OK, I need to know more about these drills…**\\n\\nDifferent finishes off one foot, off the wrong foot, having bands involved. He’s just pushing me. I get bumped a lot when I go up, so it was learning how to finish in those areas. When I shoot, they’re closing out or using a stick, one of those fluffy sticks, hitting me on my legs because, when you shoot, sometimes you get scared you’re gonna step on the ankle. So it’s trying to block all that out and just focus on your shot. Sitting in chairs, finishes with the right hand in a chair under the rim, which is really hard. Standing up in a chair and using heavy balls, big balls, small balls. (Christie) is into all that, and I really trust him. I just go with his flow and really try to learn. At the end of the day, you’re feeling the ball. You get to control the ball. It depends how serious you take the exercise if it’s actually going to help or not, so I went all in with Doug.\\n\\n**I know you gotta get on the road, so I’ll let you get out. As far as your team right now, you all are learning the hard way how the shift from surprise Cinderella team to being a team with expectations can be tough. Is the spotlight hitting you differently this season? What has that dynamic been like for you?**\\xa0\\n\\nIt’s tough to say, because our record isn’t what we think it can be. But we know we’ve dropped a lot of games where we’ve had full control. Just in this last week, the [Phoenix](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/suns/) and the [Milwaukee](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/bucks/) (losses), those would have been two wins where we would have been up in fourth or fifth (place) or whatever it is, you know? It’s tough, because we know we are better. We’ve shown it. We just sometimes go through these mental lapses in games, which are very, very controllable. We know that. There’s other games where we’ve controlled it and ended up winning the game. So we’ve just got to stay mentally strong. We need to win games to get the best seed as we can for the playoffs, but I feel like, as the year goes on, we’re learning more and more, you know? We’re seeing film, seeing what we do wrong.\\n\\nWe’re realizing these things. And the good thing is that we still have another 40 games. But it’s not going to get easier. It’s only gonna get harder as the year goes on because everyone’s fighting for this position. So it’s more about mental toughness for us.\\n\\n_(Top photo of Domantas Sabonis: Ezra Shaw / Getty Images)_\\n'}, {'sender': 'Shardul Vaidya', 'link_value': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Athena_Nike', 'plaintext_content': None, 'timestamp': Timestamp('2024-05-01 00:35:00'), 'link_jina': 'https://r.jina.ai/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Athena_Nike', 'link_content': 'Title: Temple of Athena Nike\\n\\nURL Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Athena_Nike\\n\\nPublished Time: 2004-02-25T16:58:05Z\\n\\nMarkdown Content:\\n[![Image 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Temple_of_Athena_Nik%C3%A8_from_Propylaea%2C_Acropolis%2C_Athens%2C_Greece.jpg/250px-Temple_of_Athena_Nik%C3%A8_from_Propylaea%2C_Acropolis%2C_Athens%2C_Greece.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Temple_of_Athena_Nik%C3%A8_from_Propylaea,_Acropolis,_Athens,_Greece.jpg)\\n\\nThe Temple of Athena Nike\\n\\n[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Werner_Carl-Friedrich_-_The_Temple_of_Athena_Nike._View_from_the_North-East_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/251px-Werner_Carl-Friedrich_-_The_Temple_of_Athena_Nike._View_from_the_North-East_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Werner_Carl-Friedrich_-_The_Temple_of_Athena_Nike._View_from_the_North-East_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)\\n\\nPainting of the Temple of Athena Nike, by [Carl Werner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Werner\"CarlWerner\"), 1877\\n\\nThe **Temple of Athena Nike** ([Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language\"Greeklanguage\"): Ναός Αθηνάς Νίκης, _Naós Athinás Níkis_) is a temple on the [Acropolis of Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acropolis_of_Athens\"AcropolisofAthens\"), dedicated to the goddesses [Athena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena\"Athena\") and [Nike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike_(mythology) \"Nike (mythology)\"). Built around 420 BCE, the [temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple\"Temple\") is the earliest fully [Ionic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_order\"Ionicorder\") temple on the Acropolis. It has a prominent position on a steep bastion at the south west corner of the Acropolis to the right of the entrance, the [Propylaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propylaea_(Acropolis_of_Athens) \"Propylaea (Acropolis of Athens)\"). In contrast to the Acropolis proper, a walled sanctuary entered through the Propylaea, the Victory Sanctuary was open, entered from the Propylaea\\'s southwest wing and from a narrow stair on the north. The sheer walls of its bastion were protected on the north, west, and south by the _Nike Parapet_, named for its frieze of Nikai celebrating victory and sacrificing to their patroness, [Athena and Nike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena\"Athena\").\\n\\n[Nike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike_(mythology) \"Nike (mythology)\") was the goddess of victory in [Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language\"Greeklanguage\"), and Athena was worshipped in this form, representative of being victorious in war. The citizens worshipped the goddesses in hopes of a successful outcome in the long [Peloponnesian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnesian_War\"PeloponnesianWar\") fought against the [Spartans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta\"Sparta\") and allies.[\\\\[1\\\\]](#cite_note-:1-1)\\n\\nHistory\\\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_of_Athena_Nike&action=edit&section=1\"Editsection:History\")\\\\]\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Acropolis_Athens_BM_424.jpg/220px-Acropolis_Athens_BM_424.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Acropolis_Athens_BM_424.jpg)\\n\\nScene of the [Battle of Plataea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Plataea\"BattleofPlataea\"), from the south frieze of the Temple of Athena Nike, [British Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Museum\"BritishMuseum\") (London)\\n\\n[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Propylaea_and_Temple_of_Athena_Nike_at_the_Acropolis_%28Pierer%29.jpg/220px-Propylaea_and_Temple_of_Athena_Nike_at_the_Acropolis_%28Pierer%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Propylaea_and_Temple_of_Athena_Nike_at_the_Acropolis_(Pierer).jpg)\\n\\nTemple of Athena Nike is on the right from the Propylaea\\n\\nThe cult of Athena Nike was operable in the early sixth century BCE. On the remains of a Mycenaean bastion, a cult image of Athena seated holding a pomegranate in her right hand and holding a helmet in her left was placed on top of a square limestone base. The Sanctuary of Athena Nike was demolished by the Persians in 480-479 BCE and a temple was built over the remains.[\\\\[2\\\\]](#cite_note-:0-2) The new temple construction was underway in 449 BCE and was finished around 420 BCE. The cult was supervised by the [Priestess of Athena Nike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priestess_of_Athena_Nike\"PriestessofAthenaNike\"), who was appointed through democratic allotment.[\\\\[1\\\\]](#cite_note-:1-1) If still in use by the 4th-century, the temple would have been closed during the [persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_pagans_in_the_late_Roman_Empire\"PersecutionofpagansinthelateRomanEmpire\").\\n\\nAthens fell to the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire\"OttomanEmpire\") in 1456. The temple sat untouched until it was demolished in 1686 by the Ottomans who used the stones to build defenses. In 1834 the temple was reconstructed after the independence of Greece. In 1998 the temple was dismantled so that the crumbling concrete floor could be replaced and its frieze was removed and placed in the new [Acropolis Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acropolis_Museum\"AcropolisMuseum\") that opened in 2009.[\\\\[3\\\\]](#cite_note-3) The Temple of Athena Nike is often closed to visitors as work continues. The new museum exhibit consists of fragments of the site before the [Persians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persians\"Persians\") were thought to have destroyed it in 480 BCE. Sculptures from the friezes have been salvaged such as: deeds of Hercules, statue of Moscophoros, a damaged sculpture of a goddess credited to Praxiteles and the Rampin horseman, as well as epigraphic dedications, decrees, and stelae.[\\\\[4\\\\]](#cite_note-4)\\n\\nArchitecture\\\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_of_Athena_Nike&action=edit&section=2\"Editsection:Architecture\")\\\\]\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Temple-of-Athena-Nike-Plan.gif/220px-Temple-of-Athena-Nike-Plan.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Temple-of-Athena-Nike-Plan.gif)\\n\\nFloor plan\\n\\nThe Temple of Athena Nike was finished around 420 BCE,[\\\\[5\\\\]](#cite_note-5) during the [Peace of Nicias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Nicias\"PeaceofNicias\"). It is a _[tetrastyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrastyle\"Tetrastyle\")_ (four [column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column\"Column\")) [Ionic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_order\"Ionicorder\") structure with a [colonnaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonnade\"Colonnade\") [portico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portico\"Portico\") at both front and rear [facades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade\"Facade\") (_[amphiprostyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphiprostyle\"Amphiprostyle\")_), designed by the [architect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architect\"Architect\") [Kallikrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kallikrates\"Kallikrates\"). The columns along the east and west fronts were monolithic columns. The temple ran 8 metres (26 feet) long by 5.5 metres (18 feet) wide and 7 metres (23 feet) tall. The total height from the [stylobate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylobate\"Stylobate\") to the acme of the [pediment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediment\"Pediment\") while the temple remained intact was a modest 7 metres (23 feet). The ratio of height to diameter of the columns is 7:1, rather than the more standard 9:1 or 10:1 ratio in Ionic buildings. Constructed from white [Pentelic marble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentelic_marble\"Pentelicmarble\"), it was built in stages as war-starved funding allowed.\\n\\n[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/ACMA_973_Nik%C3%A8_sandale_1.JPG/170px-ACMA_973_Nik%C3%A8_sandale_1.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ACMA_973_Nik%C3%A8_sandale_1.JPG)\\n\\nA relief from the parapet around the temple which shows [Nike fixing her sandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike_fixing_her_sandal\"Nikefixinghersandal\").

The orientation of the temple is set up so that the East Frieze sits above the entrance of the temple on the porch side. The north frieze depicted a battle between Greeks entailing cavalry. The south frieze showed the decisive victory over the Persians at the [battle of Plataea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Plataea\"BattleofPlataea\"). The east frieze showed an assembly of the gods [Athena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena\"Athena\"), [Zeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus\"Zeus\") and [Poseidon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poseidon\"Poseidon\"), rendering Athenian religious beliefs and reverence for the gods bound up in the social and political climate of 5th Century Athens. The west frieze has a good amount of the original sculpting preserved. Similar to the east frieze it is most likely telling the story of a battle, or more specifically a victory. There are multiple corpses depicted (more than any of the other three friezes) and imagery of one about to be killed with some figures wearing helmets. This battle between armies most likely is depicting the massacre of the Corinthians by the Athenians.[\\\\[6\\\\]](#cite_note-6)\\n\\nSome time after the temple was completed, around 410 BCE a [parapet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parapet\"Parapet\") was added around it to prevent people from falling from the steep [bastion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion\"Bastion\"). The outside of the parapet was adorned by carved relief sculptures showing Nike in a variety of activities, including two Nikai setting up a trophy, and all in procession.[\\\\[7\\\\]](#cite_note-7)\\n\\nArchitects [Christian Hansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Hansen_(architect) \"Christian Hansen (architect)\") and Eduard Schaubert excavated the temple in the 1830s. The building had been totally dismantled in the 17th century and the stone built into the Turkish wall that surrounded the hill. A primitive [anastylosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastylosis\"Anastylosis\") was carried out in 1836 when the temple was re-erected from remaining parts. A third restoration was completed in Summer 2010.[\\\\[8\\\\]](#cite_note-8) The main structure, [stylobate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylobate\"Stylobate\") and columns are largely intact, minus the roof and most of the [tympanae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediment\"Pediment\"). Fragments of the sculpted frieze are exhibited in the [Acropolis Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acropolis_Museum\"AcropolisMuseum\") and the [British Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Museum\"BritishMuseum\"); copies of these are fixed in their place on the temple.\\n\\n### Parapet of Nike\\\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_of_Athena_Nike&action=edit&section=5\"Editsection:ParapetofNike\")\\\\]\\n\\nOn the parapet, there would have stood a famous marble statue of a wingless Nike. The positioning of this statue has Nike leaning towards her right foot with her right arm stretching towards her sandal and her clothes slipping off her shoulder. For a while, there has been much debate over what the imagery of this statue is supposed to represent. There are many other uses of Greek sandal-related art found on cups, vases, and even on the friezes of the Parthenon. However, these versions all depict the subjects bending down with both arms stretched out to adjust or tie their sandals. The difference in imagery between one hand and two is what has caused discrepancy behind the meaning of the statue of a wingless Nike. It is most likely that Nike is instead removing or loosening her sandal as opposed to adjusting or putting it on. This use of imagery is thought to be used to demonstrate the action of removing footwear to those entering the temple to pay tribute to Athena, as this was a traditional action of worshiping in this space.[\\\\[9\\\\]](#cite_note-9) The statue was discovered in 1835 near the temple. It is thought to have stood on the south side of the temple. It is currently held by the Acropolis Museum (inventory number Ακρ. 973).[\\\\[10\\\\]](#cite_note-10)\\n\\nThe famous parapet of Nike removing her sandal is an example of [wet drapery](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wet_drapery&action=edit&redlink=1\"Wetdrapery(pagedoesnotexist)\").[\\\\[11\\\\]](#cite_note-11) Wet drapery involves showing the form of the body but also concealing the body with the drapery of the clothing. Some friezes are from the Persian and Peloponnesian wars. The friezes contained a cavalry scene from the battle of Marathon and a Greek victory over the Persians at the battle of Plataea. The battles represent Greek and Athenian dominance through military power and historical events.[\\\\[12\\\\]](#cite_note-:3-12) A statue of Nike stood in the _[cella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cella\"Cella\")_, or otherwise referred to as a _naos_. Nike was originally the \"winged victory\" goddess (_see_ the winged [Nike of Samothrace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike_of_Samothrace\"NikeofSamothrace\")). The Athena Nike statue\\'s absence of wings led Athenians in later centuries to call it _Apteros Nike_ or wingless victory, and the story arose that the statue was deprived of wings so that it could never leave the city.\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Acropolis._Beul%C3%A9_Gate._Propylaea._Temple_Nike.jpg/220px-Acropolis._Beul%C3%A9_Gate._Propylaea._Temple_Nike.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Acropolis._Beul%C3%A9_Gate._Propylaea._Temple_Nike.jpg)\\n\\nAn 1893 photograph of the Acropolis showing the [Beulé Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beul%C3%A9_Gate\"BeuléGate\"), Propylaea and the Temple of Athena Nike\\n\\nCornice and cyma\\\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_of_Athena_Nike&action=edit&section=6\"Editsection:Corniceandcyma\")\\\\]\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n### Cornice\\\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_of_Athena_Nike&action=edit&section=7\"Editsection:Cornice\")\\\\]\\n\\nThe cornice follows standard architectural design and sits immediately above the frieze and wraps around the entire structure. Many sections of the cornice that have been discovered are believed to be part of the Temple of Athena Nike, however, some archaeologists think that some of the pieces found near the temple might not be part it. These pieces of the cornice are lined on the inside with an array of holes, supporting the idea that the cornice was held in place by dowels, which connected it to the frieze. Many of these cornice pieces are so weathered and worn that the dowel holes are no longer visible.[\\\\[12\\\\]](#cite_note-:3-12)\\n\\nThe cornice stretches flat and with no moldings that would create a design. If there had been a design, it would not be sculptural. There is evidence that would suggest that the cornice would have at one point been painted. However, because the architecture has been worn for such a long time, any knowledge of what the design could have been is long lost.\\n\\n### Cyma\\\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_of_Athena_Nike&action=edit&section=8\"Editsection:Cyma\")\\\\]\\n\\nJust above the cornice, on the north and south sides of the temple, rests the cyma. They sit at an angle on both sides, creating the slope that makes up the roofing and the pediment. Stretching along the cyma is an order of lion heads that extend outward. At each end of the cyma, where the corners would turn into the east and west faces of the temple, there are cuttings just above the cyma where an akroteria would have been placed.[\\\\[12\\\\]](#cite_note-:3-12)\\n\\nAkroteria\\\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_of_Athena_Nike&action=edit&section=9\"Editsection:Akroteria\")\\\\]\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe main body of the central statue that made up the akroteria was composed of bronze, not marble. There is evidence of gold foiling and gold wiring through the main bronze core. Researchers have hypothesized on the form of the statue, but there is no trace of the original sculpture to indicate what the central akroteria really looked like. The same can be said for the statues that would make up the east and west akroteria. Both were made of bronze and it is impossible to know what the figures could have been. Theories around the figure of the central statue include the winged horse [Pegasus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus\"Pegasus\") or the monster [Chimera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(mythology) \"Chimera (mythology)\").[\\\\[2\\\\]](#cite_note-:0-2) However, these theories may be unlikely as the proportions of these animals’ bodies would not match where their feet would be placed in the akroteria\\'s base block.[\\\\[13\\\\]](#cite_note-:4-13)\\n\\n### Statue theories\\\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_of_Athena_Nike&action=edit&section=10\"Editsection:Statuetheories\")\\\\]\\n\\nA possible theory for the central akroteria would be a bronze tripod, similar to the ones that would have been on the Temple of Zeus in Olympia. This hypothesis has not been discredited for a few reasons: 1) It would be a realistic answer for the shape of the statue since the tripods dimensions would fit in the cuttings of the supporting block (unlike the animal theories). 2) A tripod would have been a likely statue to have a bronze core when serving as an acroteria. 3) The Tripod is commonly used as a symbol of victory.\\n\\nA commemorative trophy is another theory for the central akroteria that has yet to be disproven for many of the same reasons as the tripod. There are also some sculptures on the surrounding parapets that depict Nike setting up a trophy.\\n\\nThe last theory that has yet to be discredited is a central akroteria of a flying Nike. The idea is that a statue of a winged Nike would have been set just above a shield and on either side of her would have stood a Nikai holding weapons dedicated to the goddess. The akroteria at the temple of Zeus in Olympia would be a good statue for comparison with the exception of the two Nikai. This shape for the central akroteria would explain the cuttings in the supporting block that would not have matched with some of the other forms.[\\\\[13\\\\]](#cite_note-:4-13)\\n\\nSee also\\\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_of_Athena_Nike&action=edit&section=11\"Editsection:Seealso\")\\\\]\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n*   [List of Ancient Greek temples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ancient_Greek_temples\"ListofAncientGreektemples\")\\n*   [Architecture of Ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_Ancient_Greece\"ArchitectureofAncientGreece\")\\n*   [Art of Ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_of_Ancient_Greece\"ArtofAncientGreece\")\\n*   [Classical architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_architecture\"Classicalarchitecture\")\\n*   [Classical sculpture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_sculpture\"Classicalsculpture\")\\n\\nReferences\\\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_of_Athena_Nike&action=edit&section=12\"Editsection:References\")\\\\]\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n### Sources\\\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_of_Athena_Nike&action=edit&section=13\"Editsection:Sources\")\\\\]\\n\\n*   _Greek architecture_ [Encyclopædia Britannica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica\"EncyclopædiaBritannica\"), 1968.\\n*   _Greece: From Mycenae to the Parthenon_, Henri Stierlin, [TASCHEN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taschen\"Taschen\"), 2004.\\n\\n### Footnotes\\\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temple_of_Athena_Nike&action=edit&section=14\"Editsection:Footnotes\")\\\\]\\n\\n1.  ^ [_**a**_](#cite_ref-:1_1-0) [_**b**_](#cite_ref-:1_1-1) Connelly, Joan Breton, Portrait of a priestess: women and ritual in ancient Greece, Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, 2007\\n2.  ^ [_**a**_](#cite_ref-:0_2-0) [_**b**_](#cite_ref-:0_2-1) STEWART, ANDREW F.
