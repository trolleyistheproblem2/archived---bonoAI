When Sandra Evans Walsh was growing up in Parowan, Utah, her class would sometimes trek outside to a row of trees. They were about to watch history in the making, the teacher would tell them. The kids would then stare as an orange shroud spread across the sky. “I remember the clouds coming over our town and writing our names in the dust,” she said [in an interview](https://collections.lib.utah.edu/ark:/87278/s6hq8s4r) with Justin Sorensen, a geographical information systems (GIS) specialist at the University of Utah’s J. Willard Marriott Library.

That dust had traveled around 200 miles, all the way from what is now called the Nevada National Security Site, where scientists once tested nuclear weapons. Between 1945 and 1962, U.S. researchers [detonated](https://www.osti.gov/opennet/manhattan-project-history/publications/DOENuclearTests.pdf) around 200 bombs aboveground—100 of them in Nevada. Fallout from the nuclear tests—radioactive particles that were swept into the atmosphere and fell back down to the earth—found their way into crops and livestock, whose radioactivity humans took on when they consumed milk, meat and produce. Fallout takes many different chemical forms, one of which is iodine-131: an isotope, or version, of iodine that has the usual 53 protons but 78 neutrons instead of the standard 74. Inside the body, the thyroid gland will absorb iodine-131, which eventually decays to produce radiation that can causethyroid cancer and other problems.

People, such as Walsh, who lived “downwind” of nuclear development and open-air explosions are now called “downwinders.” Mary Dickson, another downwinder, [told Sorensen and one of his colleagues](https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=1246432&q) that she thought the attitude toward those in Utah who were affected by nuclear testing was, “you know, ‘They were Mormons and cowboys and Indians—who cares?’ In general, she added, “they test where they think there are populations that don’t matter.”

Sorensen and his team spoke to both women and dozens of other people for a project called the Downwinders of Utah Archive. Hosted by the J. Willard Marriott Library, the archive is an attempt to qualify, quantify and make accessible people’s experiences of, and effects from, the American legacy of nuclear weapons testing. In 2011 the Senate unanimously designated January 27 as the National Day of Remembrance for Downwinders. “The downwinders paid a high price for the development of a nuclear weapons program for the benefit of the United States,” [stated](https://www.congress.gov/112/bills/sres330/BILLS-112sres330ats.pdf) the resolution establishing the designation.

But when the tests were conducted, no one had done the research necessary to truly calculate what that price would be. Wanting to understand the potential link between regional health issues and fallout from nuclear tests, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) undertook [a study](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/i131-report-and-appendix) on Americans exposed to iodine-131 from the Nevada tests. [The results](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/i131-report-and-appendix) were released in 1997 in a report entitled “Estimated Exposures and Thyroid Doses Received by the American People from Iodine-131 in Fallout following Nevada Atmospheric Nuclear Bomb Tests.” It was this document that first led Sorensen to the archival project. “We were just kind of wondering, originally, ‘What does this data look like if you put it on a map?’” he says, “because a spreadsheet doesn’t really tell you a lot.” Sorensen’s background is in GIS and cartography, so he took the NCI’s fallout data and overlaid them onto his home state. “It just really grew from there,” he says. “We started seeing there's a story to be told.”

That story, Sorensen knew, included individual human narratives. So he and his team used their maps to pinpoint hotspots in the Beehive State. Advertising in heavily dosed places, such as St. George and Cedar City, the archivists asked people to come to their local libraries and share their experiences. “We came back with 30-plus interviews,” Sorensen says.

Some interviewees told Sorensen of men who examined their thyroids or of the potassium iodide pills teachers passed out to combat the effects of radiation. Dickson recalled watching public-information films starring [Bert the Turtle](https://www.loc.gov/static/programs/national-film-preservation-board/documents/duck_cover.pdf), who taught kids to duck and cover in the event of a nuclear explosion. The film, though, was not really a warning about what your own country might do inside its borders.

Alongside the interviews, Sorensen collected hard geospatial data and analysis. Web visitors to his archive can survey [iodine fallout maps](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9U0T4P-RpilbWdQSDg1c3ZqUFk/view?resourcekey=0-OvI6LYYD0t-7furhCq6tMQ), [diagrams of mushroom-cloud heights for different test series](https://sites.google.com/site/projectstorage2015/downwinders-screenshots/Operation%20Teapot%20Cloud%20Height%20Diagram.jpg), animations of nuclear [air drops](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9U0T4P-RpilTUxjMmhJREgtR3c/view?resourcekey=0-JDDveE0Hx-XygDkKes3f_A), [milk consumption statistics](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-EnaKGTzTEsA/VVS6uA6SFhI/AAAAAAAADSM/Y4DtDANUBwg/w1279-h959-no/Average%2BMilk%2BProduction%2B%2526%2BConsumption%2BNumbers%2Bfor%2B1954.png) from when contaminated cows passed their burden on and an [interactive timeline](https://lib.utah.edu/services/geospatial/downwinders/) of the explosive atomic age. “I was really surprised just how closely and accurately the interviews match the data,” Sorensen says. In particular, he cites a test in the Operation Upshot-Knothole series. Later the test was nicknamed “[Dirty Harry](https://www.ctbto.org/specials/testing-times/19-may-1953-dirty-harry/)” because it generated more fallout than any other continental boom, much of which ended up near St. George. “You hear this firsthand, and it brings all the information together,” he says.

Although no single illness can be conclusively tied to a test-site cause, investigations by the [United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation](http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/gareport.pdf) and the [International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War and the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research](https://ieer.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/1991/06/RadioactiveHeavenEarth1991.pdf), among others, have established links between radiation exposure and cancer occurrence. In the early 2000s a [report](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/fallout/) by NCI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that fallout could have led to around [11,000 excess deaths](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/fallout/feasibilitystudy/Technical_Vol_1_Chapter_4.pdf). The NCI has also created [a calculator](https://radiationcalculators.cancer.gov/fallout/) that allows users to calculate their thyroid dose and risk of developing thyroid cancer from fallout. “We can’t know any individual’s cancer was caused by radioactivity,” explains Scott Williams, former executive director of HEAL Utah, a nonprofit advocacy group focused on the environment and public health, “but we do know that some people’s cancer risk was increased by radioactivity.”

Since 1990 the federal government has offered some recompense to downwinders and others affected by nuclear testing through the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA). Set to expire this summer unless [a bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2798) is passed to renew (and expand) it, RECA pays downwinders, test participants and uranium workers between $50,000 and $100,000—if they have specific ailments and can prove (with decades-old evidence that is sometimes hard to come by) they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. “We left a burden on unwitting citizens across the country without ever informing them,” Williams says. “We need to do the honorable thing and own the problem and not create these problems again.”

The Downwinders of Utah Archive is always expanding, and though Sorensen paused interviews during the pandemic, he plans to light the fuse again soon. He also hopes to expand the project to other Western states to preserve their history, too.

Making sure that information remains accessible is part of the point of the Downwinders of Utah Archive. The day of remembrance is, in its own way, an isotope of that openness. “Those kind of markers are really important...,” Dickson told Sorensen and his colleague. “Otherwise, you know, time marches on, and it’s like dipping a big spoon in the water. The rest of the water just fills in, and it’s like it was never there.”

The story of continuity and change in a country with diverse ecosystems varies from region to region. It is important to consider the microhabitats and landscapes that shape the cultures and traditions we inherit. Some regions have been occupied for many millennia, resulting in a long history with no breaks or gaps in the chronology. However, there are some examples in archaeology of sites that have been occupied for a long time but have had gaps in occupation; the infamous site of [Hastinapura](https://theprint.in/opinion/bihars-chirand-has-a-4000-year-history-its-the-rising-sun-of-indias-neolithic-culture/1954039/blank) is a prime example of such chrono-cultural history.

There are also examples of a region with multiple sites deciphering the story of continuity and change, the classical example of this would be the sites of [Mehrgarh](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b7x6xx), [Nausharo](https://theprint.in/opinion/bihars-chirand-has-a-4000-year-history-its-the-rising-sun-of-indias-neolithic-culture/1954039/blank) and [Pirak](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/11263509609439562), together showcasing the evolution of culture from early farming to the Bronze Age. Therefore, it is not necessary that an individual site will have to give an entire picture of the region’s historicity; there can be multiple sites in a region that can offer you a glimpse of shifts in the cultural paradigm.

[Chirand,](https://ehrafarchaeology.yale.edu/traditions/aq50/documents/010) an archaeological site in Bihar, is a combination of these two distinct examples. The site narrates a regional evolution of society from the Neolithic to the Early Historical period after which it was deserted till the Mediaeval period. But when combined with other sites on the banks of the Ganga, such as [Maner](https://www.telegraphindia.com/bihar/new-year-date-for-maner-excavation-archaeologists-expect-to-find-artefacts-dating-back-to-neolithic-age-and-pal-period/cid/349766), [Chechar](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/relics-of-india-s-golden-age-discovered-in-bihar/story-UFBBSlznIEiQpdjvxLqzRN.html) and Senuar, it provides valuable information on the over-4000-year history of the region.

### **The Rising Sun of Bihar**

Once called the ‘rising sun of the neolithic culture in India’ by archaeologist [FR Allchin](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bulletin-of-the-school-of-oriental-and-african-studies/article/abs/f-r-allchin-piklihal-excavations-andhra-pradesh-government-archaeological-series-no-1-xvii-154-pp-64-plates-hyderabad-government-of-andhra-pradesh-1960-rs-15/899F551FD0CA064CBCB51E995001D146), Chirand is an archaeological site located in the Saran district of Bihar. The site was first reported after a surface study in the late 1800s— when Mediaeval structures and Buddhist sculptures were found. The initial excavations, conducted in 1962 by the Directorate of Archaeology and Museum, Bihar, lasted for seven field seasons till 1972-73.

A five-fold cultural sequence was revealed during the excavation which was broadly categorised as –

**Period I** – Neolithic (early food-producing period)

**Period II** – Chalcolithic (Copper-using society)

**Period III** – Northern Black Polished Ware-associated culture (linked with the rise of ancient republics)

**Period IV**– Historical period (from 1st century to 3rd century BCE)

**Period V**– Late Historical

The neolithic society at Chirand settled on the alluvial deposit of the Ganga River in circular houses made of wild reeds. A circular floor about four metres in diameter with a series of open hearths, a few post-holes near the floor and a few burnt chunks of clay with a reed impression are valuable pieces of evidence that speak volumes about neolithic settlement style and social matrix.

Bone tools, styli, tanged and socketed arrowheads, bangles of ivory and tortoise bone, and many bone ornaments from the Neolithic phase are indicative of a highly skilled society which focused on utilising animal bones in many ways. Apart from this, beads made of chalcedony, agate, jasper, marble, chert, steatite and faience—which were sources from across the subcontinent—link the settlers of Chirand to the domestic trade matrix. Material like faience must be the result of exchange with the Harappans in the west, whereas agate was probably coming from Gujarat.

The evidence of rice, wheat, barley and masoor [at Chirand](https://ehrafarchaeology.yale.edu/traditions/aq50/documents/008) suggests that people, during Period I, were cultivating cereals and legumes. Fish also was part of their diet.

Such a complex society of early farmers in eastern India at around c.2400 BCE is a marker of indigenous growth of culture, which is connected to its contemporary settlements around Chirand and across the Ganga in the west.

### **Evolution to copper**

The inclusion of metal is a sign of evolution, both of society and of technology. Copper was the first metal which slowly penetrated the social fabric i[n Chirand.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44145448) This brought about the onset of the Chalcolithic period.

The early dates of the Copper Age—which succeeded the early farming period and paved the way for iron—come from the western half of the subcontinent. But this may be a generalised statement because the juncture when the Neolithic ends and Chalcolithic begins might not follow a linear pattern in every microcosm. It can merge in the initial stages before paving the way for a full-fledged Copper Age, just like at [Maski](https://theprint.in/opinion/is-there-a-void-in-indian-history-brahmagiri-maski-hold-the-answer/1933821/), Karnataka. Moreover, in some instances, they co-exist, as we have seen in the case of [Burzahom](https://theprint.in/opinion/buzahom-can-change-story-of-evolution-until-recently-it-was-a-kashmiri-t20-cricket-ground/1474410/) and Harappa.

In the case of Chirand, both scenarios stand true. At the site, the Neolithic period slowly transitions into the Chalcolithic period. But when placing the site with its contemporary sites in the same region as Maner, the [Neolithic period of Chirand](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44145448) co-exists with the Chalcolithic period of Maner which is dated to 2600 BCE.

The Chalcolithic period in Chirand is dated around c.2000 to 1950 BCE and covers about 5.5m thickness of the total deposit. The copper-using people lived in houses made of reeds and bamboo with mud plaster and floors made of burnt earth. Circular hearths are noted in the earliest levels of the deposit. Secondary burials were also recorded during the excavation.

Bone tools continue to make an appearance along with stone beads. A few corroded pieces of copper were excavated along with a few pear-shaped terracotta beads.

This phase slowly merges into Period III— the Iron Age.

### **Towards urbanism** 

If copper marked the evolution of society and a technological shift in metallurgy, iron is credited with leading the society into urbanism. The Iron Age in the subcontinent is a much-debated topic. While the exact date of the introduction of iron is still debatable, its inclusion in the material culture is considered important— so much so that early scholars called the Iron Age the foundation of second urbanism in India.

At [Chirand](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44145448), the introduction of iron is coupled with the presence of Northern Black Polish Ware which, like iron, is a product of advanced kilning technique. Iron implements found at the site include sickles, axes, ploughshares, daggers, lances, knife blades, etc. Beads of semi-precious stones and terracotta beads are also part of the material assemblage at the site. Terracotta human and animal figures including the naga figurine are important findings. Copper antimony rods, bone arrowheads, copper-punch marked coins and cast coins were also found during this period. What is interesting is that Neolithic celts \[a tool from the period\] were also present in this period. A drastic change in settlement pattern was in the building material. Baked brick structures start to appear, with mud walls and rammed floors. Period III was followed by Period IV—from 1st century BCE to 3rd century CE—which was ruled by the Kushana dynasty. During this period big residential complexes and monastic buildings are reported. Several structural phases are noted, one of which included remnants of a monastic kitchen which yielded a terracotta torso of Hariti. An important discovery of this period was the Kushana copper coin hoard of 88 coins, and a terracotta sealing with the early Brahmi script. Period V is the last phase which revealed that the site was deserted after 3rd century CE and reoccupied after a considerable gap during the late historical and early Mediaeval period. The periodisation is indicated by the recovery of a pot with five gold coins of the Kalachuri dynasty ruler Gangeyadeva dated c.1045 CE, and the presence of an unidentified sculpture from the Pala period. ### **Continuity and change** At [Brahmagiri](https://theprint.in/opinion/is-there-a-void-in-indian-history-brahmagiri-maski-hold-the-answer/1933821/) and [Maski](https://theprint.in/opinion/is-there-a-void-in-indian-history-brahmagiri-maski-hold-the-answer/1933821/), cultures changed and the landscape evolved with time. Similarly, at Chirand, early neolithic farmers co-existed and evolved alongside the copper-using society, and at the same time distinctively showed how easily cultures change and merge at one location. From humble wattle and daub structures emerged rammed floors, community hearths, and burnt bricks, changing the settlement style which eventually became the hallmark of urbanism. The Kushana occupation that follows, is also an example of how the region, and most importantly Chirand itself, is [significant](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44145448) – perhaps due to political reasons or maybe just due to trade.

[Today](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/famous-archaeological-site-in-bihar-faces-threat-of-erosion-101624801867323.html), Chirand is rapidly being consumed by the Ganga, recently fresh excavations opened up a glorious chapter of the history of eastern India, leaving us waiting for more data.

Works of art have long been identified, and sometimes even romanticized, as ideal ways for racketeers to [launder money](https://www.artandobject.com/news/treasury-dept-warns-sanctions-art-world). There’s a thread of logic here: the art world typically accommodates those that want to anonymously buy high-dollar paintings, and on top of that, the industry allows large cash deals. For those looking to [launder money](https://www.artandobject.com/news/treasury-dept-warns-sanctions-art-world), it’s difficult to conjure up a more attractive set of circumstances than those.

There also seems to be plenty of instances where art has played a role in the act of money laundering. Consider that when the [Mexican](https://www.artandobject.com/press-release/one-greatest-living-mexican-printmakers-celebrates-mexican-revolution) government passed a law in the early 2010s to require more information about buyers, and how much cash could be spent on a single piece of art, the market cratered, as sales dipped [70 percent](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/mexican-art-galleries-suffer-as-drug-money-laws-end-anonymous-cash-buys/2014/09/16/4e5dc6c4-3d41-11e4-a430-b82a3e67b762_story.html) in less than a year. Many believed that was because Mexican cartel rings had previously been the biggest buyers in the market.

Markdown Content:
[Domantas Sabonis](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/domantas-sabonis-P1iXY4NkyOp3D6Vw/) is slightly paranoid.

Talk to those who know him best, and you’ll learn all about the disproportionate desperation that has driven him for all these years. From Oklahoma City to Indiana to this Sacramento stop that has gone so well [since he arrived in February 2022](https://theathletic.com/3511396/2022/02/08/kings-finalize-6-player-trade-to-acquire-domantas-sabonis-tyrese-haliburton-buddy-hield-to-pacers/), with three All-Star berths in between and combined earnings that will surpass $282 million by the end of his current contract, Sabonis has harbored fears of an [NBA](https://theathletic.com/nba/) fallout that should have faded by now. Especially, one might incorrectly assume, after his latest stellar season in which he was dominant and dynamic enough to finish seventh in MVP voting.

So when the 27-year-old spent last summer ramping up his training like never before, inviting [Sacramento Kings](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/sac-kings/) assistant coach Doug Christie to lead his offseason regimen near his homes in Napa, Calif., and Los Angeles while the big man overhauled his diet as a way to increase his strength, no one within his inner circle was surprised. Once he healed up from all the bumps and ([Draymond Green](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/draymond-green-qWchQbJAR0YQNMyV/)–[caused](https://theathletic.com/4423463/2023/04/18/warriors-kings-game-2-score-draymond-green/)) bruises that came with that physical first-round playoff loss to the [Golden State Warriors](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/warriors/), and with the Kings having decided to give him a five-year, $217 million extension that would secure his status as a massive piece of their revived program, he turned his attention to the annual summertime task of proving his worth. Again.

“I always feel that way,” Sabonis told _The Athletic_ with a self-aware chuckle in a recent phone interview. “My wife doesn’t like my mentality sometimes. But I’m always thinking that way — not of the worst (case-scenario), but like, ‘What if it ended today?’ Or ‘What if this or that happened?’ So I’ve gotta do the most (possible with his time).

“There’s a lot to get to work on. I know the numbers may show otherwise, but I feel like there’s so much left where I can help my teammates on the court and win games. That’s exciting as a player. Like, if I work on this, and I can do this in this situation, then that’s going to help the team. I’m always thinking of that.”

The question this week, as Sabonis is well aware, is what the NBA head coaches who pick All-Star reserves might be thinking.

Those numbers that Sabonis alluded to are even better this season than last, as he’s averaging 19.9 points, a league-leading 12.7 rebounds and a team-leading 8.0 assists for this Kings team (26-18) that is fifth in the Western Conference (he averaged 19.1, a league-leading 12.3 rebounds and 7.3 assists in the 2022-23 campaign and was voted third-team All-NBA). The [only other players averaging anywhere near a triple-double](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional?CF=PTS*GE*10:REB*GE*8:AST*GE*7&dir=-1&sort=W) this season, per NBA.com/stats, are the [Denver Nuggets’](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/nuggets/) [Nikola Jokić](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/nikola-jokic-bCjsyLGuQMrMSWNr/)  and the [Dallas Mavericks’](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/mavericks/) [Luka Dončić](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/luka-doncic-gMyReUOesjAikT7S/). Yet still, it seems, Sabonis’ foreboding vibe remains.

His perspective was no doubt shaped by his [legendary Lithuanian father, Arvydas,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF8aCCt0aw0) whose best playing days came overseas before he finally joined the Portland Trail Blazers as a 30-year-old. His father’s journey was far different — and remarkable, really — with his ill-fated NBA delay caused by everything from the Soviet Union’s [Iron Curtain that blocked him from coming to America](https://www.deseret.com/1996/5/4/19240276/what-ifs-abound-when-contemplating-sabonis) to injuries that forever changed the arc of his career. His story remains one of the great “What-ifs?” in NBA lore.

All these decades later, Domantas has a deep appreciation for his basketball life that was formed out of his family history.

“That desperation to stay over here (in the NBA vs. playing in Europe) because I love it, and try to get better, I don’t think that’s gonna change,” Sabonis said. “My family and friends always laugh at me, like, ‘Oh, you’re always gonna want more, or to keep going.’ They always know. There’s no calm time with me.”

_(The following interview has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.)_

**So from a timeline standpoint, the Warriors series ends in late April, and you take a bit to recover from there. When did you and Doug start the offseason routine?** 

We met with the (Kings) guys in Napa like a month after the season. We all got together, went to a winery, had dinner. It was the whole team, basically. We stayed at [Stanly Ranch](https://aubergeresorts.com/stanlyranch/). And yeah, a day or two after that is when I started getting back to work. I couldn’t do much at first because of my thumb.

_After suffering a fracture in his right thumb in late December, Sabonis chose against having surgery and instead_ [_played through the injury_](https://theathletic.com/4042348/2022/12/29/domantas-sabonis-thumb-injury-nba-sacramento-kings/) _for the rest of the season._

So we were doing all this rehab for it to get it right, and I couldn’t do contact or anything, so it was just dribbling, and I slowly built into it. With Jas (Randhawa, the Kings’ senior director of athlete health), we had a whole lifting program. I really wanted to get my body right. I’m an undersized big, and I play physical, but I still wanted to be stronger when you play against the bigger guys, to really be able to hold my ground and be more effective.

**So what did you change?**

Well, I usually always try to add or try new things. I want to keep trying to be better, especially while I’m still young. I always start at 6 a.m., but this year, I have my two kids, so I’d make sure I started at 6 a.m., and I’m done by maybe 11, 11:30, so then I get like an hour and a half with the kids before they have their naptime so I’m not fully gone for half of the day during the season (Domantas and his wife, Shashana Rosen, had their second child, and first daughter, in March). I changed my diet to help me. I did a test where they show you all of your things that you’re sensitive to.

**And what did you learn?**

I learned that everything I love I couldn’t eat (laughs). So it definitely was hard. It was hard. I get to do my test again after six months, and usually they say that everything you eat, a lot your body gets adapted to it, so hopefully the things I love that I’ve cut out, when I redo this test, some things might pop back up that I’m allowed to eat again.

No carbs, like wheat. I had to go gluten free. I can’t do gluten-free pasta, and I love Italian food. There’s a lot of carbs in my diet, so I had to basically cut most of them out in terms of pasta, bread. I love croissants, pastries, all that stuff. Those would be my cheat meals. So I have to stay away from that. But I actually didn’t lose weight. I actually gained weight, which is the craziest thing. I just have like no body fat now. … The weight is still there — 248 to 250 (pounds). That’s where I stay at during the season. But the body fat is completely down. It wasn’t high before, but now it’s like nothing.

That’s definitely helped me. I feel lighter. I don’t get as tired on the court. I wake up better. So I did all those things that the tests showed me, and that definitely had an impact. I have kids now, so that means less naptime. But I feel great. And I love to nap, so I always thought that was gonna be an issue, but it definitely hasn’t been.

**Let’s go back to the basketball part of the program. What did that look like?**

We just really worked on everything that teams are going to give up on me (defensively), ways that I can get guys more open, more involved, situations where I usually passed up on (opportunities) sometimes to get the offense flowing and whatnot. Sometimes I could be open, but it’s like, “OK, this is where I have to get (Kings forward) Keegan (Murray) the ball or (guard) Kevin (Huerter) the ball,” to get them going so the whole offense clicks. We worked on situations where, if I need to be more aggressive, I have options to go to. We worked on the right hand a lot, and the jump shooting of course. We just really focused on those things, and Doug’s been great. He’s been showing me film on all these little things that we could add. Honestly, I feel like there’s still a lot of room to improve. I always feel like there’s more. It’s kind of hard to add things. It was a tough summer, because when you’re ranked the No. 1 offense in history, there’s not much more to add, you know what I mean?

_While the Kings’ offensive rating of 118.6 last season was the best in league history, they’re currently 12th (117; [Indiana](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/pacers/) has the top mark at 121.2)._

You don’t want to do too much. Maybe that’s what our struggles were in the beginning (of the season) with our offense. Everyone came back and wanted to add more, you know? And everyone had career years (last season). But with an offense like this, you can’t really add more. Everyone knows their role, and you just got to be more efficient, basically.

I think we’ve definitely showed strides in the last 10 games, even though the record hasn’t shown it, but offensively, we’ve done better. The ball has been hopping more, guys have been shooting more confidently. Playing the Warriors ([in a 134-133 win on Thursday](https://theathletic.com/5229249/2024/01/26/harrison-barnes-kings-warriors-recap/)) helps because they’re a really fast team, so it kind of got us back into that flow again. But yeah, we’ll see. We’ll see as the games go on.

**So paint the picture of your training setup in Napa.** 

Well I usually spend time in Napa, and then the other half was in L.A. (after). In Napa, I have a home gym, in terms of a weight room, and then I have a (basketball) gym down the hill from my house like two minutes away. It’s a high school. They’re super nice. It’s a connection I have. They let us come in whenever we want. And we come in early. It’s easy. Doug would basically live out in Napa with me in the summer. I would work out Monday through Friday; Saturday and Sundays would be off. Anytime I wanted to go at night to shoot or whatever, and the gym is right there, they would let me. We basically had our own key. It was basically like our own gym. So that was pretty sweet. And building the weight room out at home was the best thing ever, because that’s like two hours of your day that I’m at home and kids and the fam can come in and can join. It’s just easy. I’m not gone for so long, you know?

With Doug, it’s very natural. We can be ourselves. He’s been a player. I respect him as a player and a person, so it really just flows easy. And then once (Kings assistant coach Leandro) Barbosa came, having him helped a lot more too because that’s a guard who still can play. I played against him in FIBA competitions. We can play ones, and then when any other teammate came to work out with me this summer we could do two-on-two. (Barbosa) is a full player. He’s aggressive, really good on defense. So that would really help me out on those more physical, smaller guys when they go through switching situations. We definitely thought about it all and just went through everything. And Doug is crazy with his methods, so every day was a different crazy drill. If people saw what I was doing , they’d be like, “What is this?” Special type of finishes, dribbling exercises. Every day, he would just switch it up, so he would just keep it exciting and fun.”

**OK, I need to know more about these drills…**

Different finishes off one foot, off the wrong foot, having bands involved. He’s just pushing me. I get bumped a lot when I go up, so it was learning how to finish in those areas. When I shoot, they’re closing out or using a stick, one of those fluffy sticks, hitting me on my legs because, when you shoot, sometimes you get scared you’re gonna step on the ankle. So it’s trying to block all that out and just focus on your shot. Sitting in chairs, finishes with the right hand in a chair under the rim, which is really hard. Standing up in a chair and using heavy balls, big balls, small balls. (Christie) is into all that, and I really trust him. I just go with his flow and really try to learn. At the end of the day, you’re feeling the ball. You get to control the ball. It depends how serious you take the exercise if it’s actually going to help or not, so I went all in with Doug.

**I know you gotta get on the road, so I’ll let you get out. As far as your team right now, you all are learning the hard way how the shift from surprise Cinderella team to being a team with expectations can be tough. Is the spotlight hitting you differently this season? What has that dynamic been like for you?** 

It’s tough to say, because our record isn’t what we think it can be. But we know we’ve dropped a lot of games where we’ve had full control. Just in this last week, the [Phoenix](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/suns/) and the [Milwaukee](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/bucks/) (losses), those would have been two wins where we would have been up in fourth or fifth (place) or whatever it is, you know? It’s tough, because we know we are better. We’ve shown it. We just sometimes go through these mental lapses in games, which are very, very controllable. We know that. There’s other games where we’ve controlled it and ended up winning the game. So we’ve just got to stay mentally strong. We need to win games to get the best seed as we can for the playoffs, but I feel like, as the year goes on, we’re learning more and more, you know? We’re seeing film, seeing what we do wrong.

We’re realizing these things. And the good thing is that we still have another 40 games. But it’s not going to get easier. It’s only gonna get harder as the year goes on because everyone’s fighting for this position. So it’s more about mental toughness for us.
